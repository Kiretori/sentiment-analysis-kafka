UnitedHealthcare ex-employee reveals how company taught them to deny claims: 'Get the client off the phone' - Times of India,No Content,1445,51," *UnitedHealth* is facing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the *company* misused AI to *deny* specific insurance *claims*.; I remember trying to argue about some bullshit claim they didn't want to pay the hospital and the hospital said $300 was exactly what it cost to have a 20 minute consultation. I had to ask them why it costs so much to have a 20 minute conversation about our medical history, can they please send me a itemized bill about that crazy charge as the usual tips and tricks suggest I do when trying to talk down a cost. The hospital later mailed me the itemized bill explaining the charge, which simply said ""Consultation = $300"". 

I'm surprised they managed to make it fit on one page.; I remember reading how this team at a call centre had the best average response time to callers by several minutes. The team lead would make new starters sign an NDA to not reveal the strategy. Ex-employee comes out and reveals the strategy, which was quite literally just hanging up the phone on callers to reduce response time.

Fuck them all.

Maybe contemplate this isn't lone wolf and the overall sentiment out in the real world is the ""clients"" absolutely know their provider doesn't truly give a shit about them. 

Honestly, I've passed a few UHC signs (and a UHC booth at a street fair) and you couldn't pay me enough to stand anywhere close to their signs for the next person who decides to go full Luigi. 

It would be great if this was a wake up call for UHC, but...

South Korea to inspect Boeing aircraft as it struggles to find cause of plane crash that killed 179,No Content,3665,422,"Hate the emotive headline: ""struggles"".

A bird strike on approach caused the left engine to fail and they executed a go around.

Instead of flying to a holding point and running checklists to diagnose the problem and figure out a solution they took a mere 7 minutes to execute a complete 180, forgot to configure the flaps and gear, floated down the runway because they were expecting the gear to be out, and then went full power on the remaining engine to try another go around but it was too late.

"Second Jeju Air plane experiences landing gear malfunction, same Boeing model involved",No Content,2261,176,"hmm maintenance?; >Initial investigations suggest a malfunction in all three landing gear systems was the primary cause of the tragic accident. A bird strike is also suspected to have caused the landing gear to fail. 

I find it hard to understand how a bird strike could cause a catastrophic malfunction in all **three** landing gears. Given what others have pointed out about the age of the plane model and how often it is flown worldwide, such an fault, if it exists, should have been uncovered long ago.; “Same Boeing model” aka one of the most used airplane models in the world. Without knowing more, this is clickbait. ; >same Boeing model involved(!!!!!)  

One of the most common models of aircraft in use.  

And, the first incident involved an aircraft that was 15 years old, so very unlikely to be a production problem at Boeing that is the source of the problem, more likely maintenance issues.; Brother in law was an airplane mechanic.  He said when a wheel falls off or gear stops working it is a maintenance problem.; it's important to remember that these kinds of incidents are complex and jumping to conclusions about the cause before all the facts are in isn't really helpful the focus should be on a thorough investigation.; Low cost carriers like Jeju will generally use only one type of airplane for their entire fleet. Or at least will do so as much as possible. So if Jeju has other problems soon, they will be on Boeing aircraft. Likely on 737-800s.; Do not rule out that they have modified the landing gear. This is what SAS did to their De Havilland Q series planes and wouldn't accept responsibility.; No way that the first, fatal incident was because of the landing gear. There was only 4 minutes between the bird strike and the crash. Something else went terribly wrong. It likely included major pilot error. They didn't have enough time to run any of the required checklists.;

Meta envisages social media filled with AI-generated users,No Content,102,101,"We're already there, and it's not a good experience.

More and more Facebook posts & adverts are bot/AI generated shit.

People and pages I do not like or follow should not appear in my feed either. It's NOT engaging.

Give me a sitewide block button that works for that type of content and I'd happy. I've spent years blocking nearly every advertiser I see on the platform that I now only get nutcase & snake oil adverts. And the ""show me less"" features do absolutely nothing.

And ""content you might like"" and adverts are different things.

Facebook can only show you a certain amount of adverts even though, there's literally millions of active ads that you're the target audience for. Because of that, Facebook struggles to provide you with anything remotely relevant. Facebook Ads are HARD to automate, they take a lot of asset management & predefined coding to automate. So much so, we built a profitable product to make it easier - and it's still fucking complex.

But content you might like is easy. Anything currently getting likes/comments, that sits within one of your many lookalike audiences - loads of choice, and no limit on how many they can show. Which is why it's become most of your feed - and this is the AI generated slop we're seeing more of.

I used to work as a software engineer on a platform that used Facebook Ads, so I know how it works. It builds audiences around interests, and lookalikes from similar interests. So you get bundled up in audiences for shit that some other fuckhead likes, even though you'd despise everything else that person likes but you both once saw an image of a bike - so now you're linked together.

Every account has thousands of interests attached internally. But as a user you can't control it, or opt out of the interests & lookalike audiences - so you get whatever shit is popular or paid for. It's infuriating.; Who the damn fuck wants this; Isn’t most of the stuff on facebook just bots these days anyway? Like that’s the reason no one likes it,  it’s just bots and advertising.; The dead internet wasn’t a theory but a prophecy; I envisages a world without Facebook, and its wonderful.; What a wonderful future awaits! /s
I personally think it's for the better, maybe that way we can unglue our attention from this kind of sites; Gotta find a way to show growth to investors. Fake it til you make it.; Oh great, more bots. Just what we need, right? I can already see the chaos:

* You’re arguing with someone about pineapple on pizza, and it turns out they’re an AI programmed to troll you into ordering Domino’s.
* Platforms will probably flood with fake users hyping up products. ""Wow, I *totally* love this new Meta VR headset. It’s life-changing!"" 🫠
* Imagine having a wholesome convo about cats, only to realize you’ve been bonding with Skynet the whole time.

Honestly, if they label them clearly and use them for useful stuff like answering questions or moderating garbage content, fine, whatever. But if they’re just trying to pad engagement stats or push ads harder? Hard pass. We already have enough trust issues with social media as it is.

TL;DR: Could be cool if done right, but knowing Meta, it’s probably not gonna be done right.; So many bots on the Internet that AI is learning from bot postings; Eh, at least it'll blend in with the boomers 🤷‍♀️",2024-12-30T05:03:15,MetaKnowing,https://www.ft.com/content/91183cbb-50f9-464a-9d2e-96063825bfcf

China unveils the future of high-speed rail with a next-gen prototype,No Content,1178,241,"I had a double-take when I read these comments. The article is about China and we're on a global subreddit. Why is everyone talking about the US?!

Japan is going very slowly on that front. Not sure if China is actively developing any more maglev lines.; These are the kind of wars I want to see.; This was meant to be a reply to a comment about how China is to be applauded for technological advances, but criticized for prioritizing advancement ahead of safety; annoyingly, the comment was deleted before I finished writing my reply. So I’m posting it here anyways:

China had one fatal HSR accident thirteen years ago. This remains the only fatal incident involving China’s HSR network. 

This accident puts China on par with other countries that have experienced fatal HSR accidents, like Germany, France, and Italy. 

Considering that no other fatal HSR accidents have occurred in China in the thirteen years since that crash, during which their network has grown to be larger and to carry more people than the rest of the world’s HSR networks combined… in the context of high-speed rail, it’s really not accurate to claim that China pursues technological advancement at the expense of safety.; The CR450 was designed to run at 450kph, but in view of railway conditions and energy consumption, it actually operates at 400kph. Energy consumption is 30 per cent less than that of the previous generation CR400.; There's too much local democracy and local input when it comes to infrastructure in the US. Infrastructure is one of the few things that should come from a top-down central authority. Sometimes, the voters and their representatives are too stupid to know what's good for them.

And yes, there is precedent for this. Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay's American System promoted federal support for infrastructure such as roads and canals.

Specifically, when discussing matters of endocrinology and pharmacology, it really needs a lot of guardrails in order to keep focus and give answers that rhyme with the right answer. Even then, there are times where it's saying the exact opposite of the truth.

I'm amazed that it would be remotely considered for anything medically related. At least with software development, whatever it puts out is evident during runtime but that's not how medicine works at all.; yeah let's use predictive text to treat patients, makes perfect sense /s; Here's the problem, not often seen in these kind of articles. (Emphasis added.) 

> Fundamentally, **generative AI is just a word prediction machine**, searching large amounts of data without really understanding the underlying concepts it is returning. It is not “intelligent” in the same sense as a real human, and it is especially not able to understand the circumstances unique to each specific individual; it is returning information it has generalized and seen before.; That's the Profit over Patient model. We've been using it for years. It produces great results for the profit side; Wait, we can make healthcare in the US worse???; It’s probably the same A.I. to summarize health insurance claims well.; This article sucks.

It's not any kind of actual study. It's anecdotal instances from individual doctors.

>She opens her laptop to ChatGPT and types in a test patient question. “Dear doctor, I have been breastfeeding and I think I developed mastitis. My breast has been red and painful.” ChatGPT responds: Use hot packs, perform massages and do extra nursing.

>But that’s wrong, says Daneshjou, who is also a dermatologist. In 2022, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine [recommended](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/ABM%20Protocol%20%2336.pdf) the opposite: cold compresses, abstaining from massages and avoiding overstimulation.

First, modern systems always or almost always provide a caveat that they are not medical professionals and you shouldn't rely solely on them for medical guidance.

For this particular example, it's interesting that they do not put ChatGPT's response in quotation marks, which makes me wonder if it's the literal answer. I tried it myself and got:

>I’m not a medical professional, but I can share some general information that may be helpful. Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast tissue that often results from a blocked milk duct or a bacterial infection. It’s relatively common in breastfeeding women. Here are a few steps that might help:

>**Continue Breastfeeding or Pumping** Even though it might be painful, it’s important to keep the milk flowing. Frequent emptying of the breast can help clear up a blockage. If breastfeeding is too painful, you can try pumping or hand-expressing milk from the affected breast.

>**Apply Warm Compresses** Placing a warm compress on the affected breast for a few minutes before nursing or pumping can help improve milk flow and ease discomfort.

>**Massage Gently** Massaging the breast—in a gentle, outward motion toward the nipple—while nursing, pumping, or in the shower can help unblock the duct and encourage milk flow.

According to the doctor cited in the story, this advice is bad. 

But the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mastitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374834) says:

>**It's safe to keep breastfeeding if you have mastitis**. Breastfeeding helps clear the infection. Weaning your baby suddenly might make your symptoms worse.

>Lightly **massage** the breast while breastfeeding or pumping milk. Start at the affected area and move down toward the nipple. Do not press hard or squeeze.

>Make sure your breast drains all the way during breastfeeding. If you have trouble emptying your breast, put **a warm, moist cloth** on the breast before breastfeeding or pumping milk.

So is the Mayo Clinic full of shit?

My favourite will always be the one where this one researcher showed that Xerox scanners and copiers were changing numbers and letters on documents that were scanned in with them.; It's like the McDonald's ice cream machine; From a legal point of view (regarding the customers) it would be interesting what the contracts between Newag and their buyers say and if there is any section in it which would make repairs at Newag mandatory. Cause if this has never been part of the contract anywhere then Newag is totally fucked if their customers decide to sue them over this (which they would likely do).

Additionally, even if it WAS part of the contract and the customer had damages (trains breaking down, resulting in costs of course) because of the way this was implemented and enforced and being triggered by error, they should still have a good case against Newag.

Newag shouldn't waste their juridical resources on the guys who discovered their game, they should rather prepare for a shitload of lawsuits from their customers.

Internet crackdown shrinks already constrained room for activism in Vietnam,No Content,109,4,"For Thảo, a journalist based in Hanoi, online reports from Vietnamese internet users were key to her and her colleagues’ coverage of Typhoon Yagi and its aftermath. The storm, the biggest in Asia this year and the strongest to strike Vietnam in 70 years, made landfall in the country’s north on Sept. 7.

Millions pf people were reportedly affected, especially in northern areas overwhelmed by severe flooding and landslides. The government estimated that Yagi caused about $2 billion worth of damage to the Vietnamese economy and could hinder its GDP growth by 0.15%.

Many state media outlets did not have the budget to dispatch reporters to the affected regions,” says Thảo, who’s affiliated with a state media outlet and asked not to use her real name. “Plus, many \[state-affiliated\] reporters were not willing to visit the sites for safety reasons. Those who could reach affected areas reported blocked and damaged roads due to heavy flooding.”

That made reports from citizen journalists of prime importance, she says. Yet not all such contributions to the coverage of the unprecedented disaster were welcomed by the state.

Amid the typhoon, the Vietnamese government warned citizens of the “storm” of fabricated news on social media. The Ministry of Public Security’s Cyber Security and High-Tech Crime Prevention Bureau also threatened rigorous action against individuals and organizations spreading what it deemed to be inaccurate information that might adversely impact natural disaster prevention and control efforts.

On the ground, this meant fines for users deemed to be publishing false news, such as two social media users in Hà Nam province who posted photos of flooding with the caption “Hà Nam has fallen,” or an individual in Thái Nguyên province accused of sharing unverified information about a rescue helicopter he claimed could assist stranded residents.

In all of these incidents, the one-party state was the sole arbiter of what constituted truths and untruths. As Thảo puts it: “In Vietnam, fake news includes both unverified news and news unapproved by the state agencies.”

Now, a new regulation is poised to place greater limitations on the Vietnamese public’s ability to share news and information online. On Nov. 9, the Vietnamese government passed Decree No. 147/2024 on the management, provision, and use of the internet and online activities. This decree, effective from Dec. 25, 2024, not only imposes further restrictions on internet usage but also stands to heighten the risks associated with environmental activism in the country.

  
Twenty-seven years since the arrival of the internet in Vietnam, the country of 100 million people has an internet penetration rate approaching 80%, yet remains among the most restricted cyberspaces in Southeast Asia. Freedom House, a U.S. nonprofit that advocates for democracy and political freedom, has classified Vietnam as “not free” for several years in a row when it comes to internet freedom, based on three criteria: obstacles to access, limits on content, and violations of user rights. It’s score this year, 22 out of 100 (with 100 being most free), is unchanged from 2023.

"Lyft sues San Francisco, claims the city overcharged $100 million in taxes — Classifying workers as independent contractors, not employees, is contentious under law in global markets",No Content,1192,98,"[deleted]; By Shubhangi Goel, Business Insider:

*Lyft has accused the city of San Francisco in a lawsuit of overcharging it $100 million in taxes over five years, arguing that the city used a calculation that doesn't reflect the ride-hailing firm's business model.*

*The lawsuit, filed at the California Superior Court in San Francisco, says the city calculated Lyft's 2019 to 2023 taxes based on the total amount passengers paid for rides. But Lyft says it makes money from what drivers pay to Lyft, not what passengers pay to the drivers. Drivers make at least 70% of what the passenger pays, according to Lyft's website.*

*Lyft considers drivers as customers who use its service and not employees, the company said in the state court complaint.*

*[...] Last year, gig-economy companies scored a big win after a California appeals court upheld a law that classified gig workers as independent contractors, not employees. But that argument hasn't always worked out for these companies in other markets: In 2021, the UK ruled that Uber drivers must be treated as company employees and not independent workers after a five-year legal battle.*; They want to have their cake and eat it too, they want to say that they are subcontracting their rides, while also treating the money riders pay them like money payed to an employee.; For those that didn’t read or don’t understand, Lyft’s argument is quite straightforward and consistent with their financial reporting (sec) and state + federal taxes. The city is financially incentivized to disagree. 

Passenger pays $100 in fare. 
-> $60 goes to Driver 
-> $40 goes to Lyft 

The $60 going to the driver will be counted as 1099 Contractor Income and is subject to income tax when the driver files their state and federal return. 

The $40 going to Lyft is recorded as revenue and goes towards funding operating expenses. 

San Francisco taxes are applied at the full fare of $100, and Lyft is arguing that it should be applied at the $40 that Lyft receives. Otherwise, it’s essentially a gross revenue tax on both the driver (a worker earning income) and Lyft. For any other company that employs people, this would be applied at the $100 level because the driver is part of Lyft and therefore the $100 goes entirely to Lyft’s revenue. 

The analogy is that you buy furniture from ikea $1000, pay a sales tax of 10%. But the assembly of furniture through your third party, won’t be billed with a 10% sales tax as well. 

Would this result in lower fares? Probably not. Lyft will just line their pockets more with the extra money consumers have become used to paying.; Maybe Lyft is “right” in this case but Lyft and Uber popularized using “independent contractors” and it’s taking over many industries. Many companies now treat contractors as full time employees in virtually every way that benefits the company but not the workers. 

Contractors should be used for truly temporary needs. 

Need extra hands for two weeks at Christmas? Sure. 

Need someone to digitize old paper records for 4 months? Sure. 

Need a drafter to handle as-built drawings for the foreseeable future? This person should be an employee. 

Need cleaning staff for your office? This person should be an employee. 

I am fine with what is essentially a trial period but it needs to have a time limit that is less than half of the year. There needs to be a very long cool down period to prevent ending then restarting the contract every short contract period.; Shouldn’t they just count the entire fare as Revenue and deduct the driver’s share as expense? 

Apple for instance claims 100% of the revenue from app purchases as gross revenue and deduct how much the developer gets as expense. 

In either case, net profit is unchanged.; Fuck Lyft!  They deactivated my rider account for a violation of the rules but, won't tell me what I did (I have a perfect ride history and always tipped) and won't let me appeal my case.  I was in Chicago when they did it and couldn't scoot/bike in huge areas of town with my friends.  Not the end of the world but just why? They lost at least $100 from me that trip and 200 my next trip there.; If they are employees, are they paying them all kinds of benfts a employee will get?; At first I was like Lyft are being dicks and greedy however it seems California wants to double-dip it's tax income from the drivers 1099 and also the full revenue fair.  

Reading the comments I would actually side with Lyft on only getting taxed on the 30% of each ride which is their cut. 

Still. Taxing gross revenue to me is weird and against my lifetime layman understanding of corporate taxation.

Thanks ya'll for the comments explaining this.; Fuck you, pay your employees.",2024-12-28T02:22:25,marketrent,https://www.businessinsider.com/lyft-suing-san-francisco-overcharging-income-tax-2024-12
"Bench shuts down, leaving at least 35,000 U.S. businesses without access to accounting and tax docs — Startup previously raised $113 million from backers such as Shopify and Bain Capital Partners",No Content,7898,439,"How the fuck does a Series C company with 650+ employees just shut down overnight leaving all their customers stranded? This isn't a two-man crypto scam operating out of a Hong Kong basement. High profile investors, board of directors, financial audits? No one fucking knew the company was going under until this morning?; This is a message from the former CEO on this 

—-

I’m very sad today to see that Bench Accounting has shut down.

I’ve avoided speaking publicly about Bench since just over 3 years ago when I was fired from the company I co-founded. I still don’t have a lot of appetite to talk about it tbh, but think at least a short statement is appropriate.

In November 2021 I went out for what I thought would be a regular lunch with one of my board members. We had just raised a Series C and turned down a highly lucrative acquisition offer. We had budding partnerships with companies like Shopify that were interested in the technology we were developing. We were winning.

The board member thanked me for bringing the company to this point, but that they would be bringing in a new professional CEO to “take the company to the next level.”

I had been battling with some of the board members over strategy. They wanted me to take the company in a new direction that I thought was a very bad idea. I wanted to continue with what was working and with what our partners had signed on to distribute. I was intransigent.

Rather than continuing to fight with me, they opted just to just replace me, thinking that they could run the company better themselves. I was totally convinced that their approach would destroy the company. I opted to resign from the board rather than fight. Because on the off-chance that I was wrong, I wanted to give them the best chances of succeeding. 

I reasoned that if they were right and I’m just a wrong-headed founder who won’t listen, then I should just fully get out of the way so they can see their vision through. And on a personal level, I just didn’t think I could stand to watch them dismantle the company I had spent a decade building.

So I moved on. I started off fresh and built a new company (Teal). Earlier this year we successfully exited to Mercury.  Things are going well and I’m excited for what we’re up to.

I hope the story of Bench goes on to become a warning for VCs that think they can “upgrade” a company by replacing the founder. It never works.

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iwcrosby_im-very-sad-today-to-see-that-bench-accounting-activity-7278491381528981506-wQkZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios; My business was a Bench bookkeeping customer during 2023. I’m not surprised at all at this news. They were shockingly terrible.

-  we had 5 (!) different bookkeepers assigned to us over the 8 months that we were a customer. Each time, the previous bookkeeper would announce that they were leaving the company.

- Likely because of the terrible employee retention, they never learned our processes and needed so much clarification and correction that it felt like we were actually the ones doing our books.

- despite frequent and aggressive follow up, we didn’t get our 2023 books until September of 2024. Resulting in 2 delays in filing our taxes.

- when we finally got our books, our tax filer was so dissatisfied with them that she basically redid them from the ground up.; Intuit is the devil but between quickbooks online and my local bookkeeper I’m quite happy with our services. Local bookkeeper is also super affordable and knows my business.; Benched startup recommends migrating to OpenAI-backed startup:

*[...] The company’s entire website is currently offline except for the notice, leaving thousands of businesses in the lurch. Bench touted having more than 35,000 U.S. customers just hours before it was shut down, according to a snapshot saved by the Internet Archive.*

*Bench, which had raised $113 million from high-profile backers such as Shopify and Bain Capital Partners, developed a software platform to help customers store and manage their bookkeeping and tax reporting documents.*

*The move is a shock to current and former customers. Justin Metros, the co-founder and CTO of Radiator, said years of his company’s accounting and tax documents are still stored on the site, although he no longer uses the platform. He learned about the shutdown from TechCrunch.*

*[...] The notice recommends customers migrate to Kick, a new accounting startup that announced its $9 million seed raise in October 2024 in a round led by OpenAI and General Catalyst.*; Bench ran at a loss the entire 5 years i worked there. There was a continuous exploration of ideas to figure out how to make it profitable, multiple failed partnerships that didn't bring in customers, a short fling with banking etc, expensive product design and I would argue inflated senior leadership team size and wage packet. 

At its core, it could not get past the customer volume per employee needed to become profitable. In the last 3 years, this shifted to an increase in customers per bookkeeper combined with handing more duties to machine learning and a restructuring of operations away from  personalised bookkeeper to volume. This of course, led to a reduction in quality, delay in service delivery, and ultimately increase in churn which fed the same cycle again.

It couldn't stay in that high quality service bracket with its old structure because it would have gone out of business. It couldn't scale a solution to work either sadly. 

It's a shame because the average employee gave so much during my time there. Thankfully I got out earlier than this but it is sad to see so many of my former colleagues impacted.; Shopify (lead by Tobi) has a pretty terrible record when it comes to buying/investing in companies.

Years ago they bought some company called Sello which was a complete flop.

They’ve lost hundreds of millions on their attempts at fulfillment.

You’d think they’d be a bit more cautious with throwing money around.; A sad day for the partner at Bain Cap who made this investment and won’t earn more than $5M this year as a result. 

Salt of the earth folk, they are.; It’s almost like having critical corporate items entirely reliant on third party cloud services without local backup could be a bad idea.

As a general rule, if Bane Capital is involved in a company, you should probably not do business with them. Bane exists to mine companies to extinction. They don’t build or create and only destroy.; Had a client come over from Bench. When Bench sent me their books, the books were so bad, I spent the first 20 minutes in awe staring at them and then the next 15 minutes laughing my ass off.

The client said Bench was doing a ""great job.""

So they must have had great PR/customer service because they sure as shit didn't know their accounting.

I'd hope the people investing time and money into nuclear companies would want to go all-in, it's a win for everyone.; They got involved in nuclear because their internal technical assessments, some of which I have read, indicated that the electrical capacities needed in the U. S. in the next 50 years could only be met partially from current power plants + green and renewables power generation.  They realized that before long the U. S. would need to turn to new nuclear plants to close the gap.  In general, it is in the best interest of the U. S. , and its national security , to make use of as many energy sources as possible.; Why wouldn't they own shares in both types of companies that work well together? I really don't see the problem here.; This is something I can get behind. Nuclear power is much safer today, clean and powerful.; I wonder if these tech companies understand that they will be beholden to the government when it comes to nuclear power.  Like, the moment any incident happens, they will 100% lose control of the plant until said issues are addressed and they can prove to the NRC they will NOT fuck it up again.  And if they do fuck it up again, NR (the military NRC) will come in and take control.   

For those who do not know, the NRC ultimately answers to NR, but NR let's the NRC handle things until they deem the NRC inadequate, which is typically on a 2 strike rule or a fuck up so bad, it requires military involvement.

Arizona experimenting with AI for full teaching roles feels like prioritizing efficiency over the humanity of education.; Isn't Arizona a leading state in education??  We should trust them. /s; Oh good, I was wondering when they were going to get rid of those pesky teachers that so willingly work so hard on teaching young minds the building blocks necessary for life. Besides, AI will be able to decipher whether or not a child actually needs to go to the bathroom or not, understand if a child needs after school tutoring, report abuse from other classmates or parents and other human qualities that really don’t matter in the classroom /s; This is a new way for them to indoctrinate kids in charter schools. It’s a 2 hour block from specific “learning companies”; I went to a “self paced” Christian school in Arizona with “guides” instead of teachers. The school lasted 2 years, and I spent the next 2 years in special Ed playing catch-up. I still have major holes in my learning.

There are so many problems here.

- you can’t learn all of math science, social studies, civics, and English in 2 hours a day.
- tools like IXL and Kahn academy are not there to teach you. They are study aids that help you practice. They tend to move way too fast through the material, with little repetitive practice. Then get stuck when the material is too hard, with no good way to backtrack and catch up on what you missed out.
- a self paced program like this is very easy to get around. I looked busy for 2 years but learned nothing. Kids will find ways to get their phones to answer, or use random guess.
- teaching aids will be much less motivated (and qualified) to help. My aids just sat in the corner and gossiped. The only time they interacted with us was the 20 minutes of “PE” we had 3 times a week.

This is a terrible idea that will cause real harm to students. I survived, I even got through college (took 8 years), but it was demoralizing, taught me horrible habits that I had to unlearn in college (failed half my classes the first 2 years), and it has not set me up for success, or provided any other social benefits. 

Public schools are there to help all kids learn. That includes kids with social anxiety, physical disabilities, ones that have poor home life, and a thousand other types. It is critical for our country to have a strong public school system, so no kids are left on their own.; I remember this episode of recess lol turned out exactly how you think it would.; It’s 40k a year. Probably will become popular with child actors and Olympic parents if they can offer it online; This is fucked.",2024-12-20T17:53:50,MetaKnowing,https://gizmodo.com/arizona-schools-curriculum-will-be-taught-by-ai-no-teachers-2000540905

Researchers can also use an AI agent to generate 3D physics simulations from text prompts.

The accelerated simulation means a neural network for piloting robots can spend the virtual equivalent of decades learning to pick up objects, walk, or manipulate tools during just hours of real computer time.

"Worry About Misuse of AI, Not Superintelligence",No Content,556,31,"**TLDR COFFEE BREAK SUMMARY**



While conversations about artificial intelligence (AI) often emphasise the potential dangers of artificial general intelligence (AGI), the more immediate risks come from human misuse of existing AI systems. Examples include lawyers being penalised for relying on AI-generated false information, increased non-consensual deepfakes, and companies using the ""AI"" label to market flawed tools that affect critical decisions in hiring, healthcare, and the justice system. Misuse can range from excessive reliance on these systems to intentional exploitation, highlighting the urgent need for regulation and vigilance. The challenges of distinguishing real content from fake and the potential for misuse across various sectors underscore the necessity of addressing these risks rather than focusing solely on speculative concerns about AI autonomy.; I like how ""the lawyer "" is the real victim in that metaphor and not the actual person who is facing imprisonment or death.; A.I. doesn't kill people, people kill people. 

I'm so glad to see the 2A argument popping up in new places.; The danger is from room temperature middle management thinking they can use ai to replace people.; I want to say this is obvious but I’m surprised by how many people don’t see it that way.; Oh, I worry about both. The military superintelligence that escapes confinement is the one that won't have any qualms bio-engineering some kind of mega-ebola and infecting everybody on the planet with it. Misuse of AI -> superintelligences that are so good at surveillance, manipulation, and murder no human or group of humans can stop them. We **don't** want to go down this road (although we will); Sounds like something super intelligent ai would say.; Or.. both?

AI is all about data. Reams and reams of data are needed to train algorithms to do what we want, and what goes into the AI models determines what comes out. But here’s the problem: AI developers and researchers don’t really know much about the sources of the data they are using. AI’s data collection practices are immature compared with the sophistication of AI model development. Massive data sets often lack clear information about what is in them and where it came from. 

The Data Provenance Initiative, a group of over 50 researchers from both academia and industry, wanted to fix that. They wanted to know, very simply: Where does the data to build AI come from? They audited nearly 4,000 public data sets spanning over 600 languages, 67 countries, and three decades. The data came from 800 unique sources and nearly 700 organizations.

Has the Rate of Technological Advancement Slowed Down?,"First off, I’m asking this because I want somebody to convince me otherwise. I think there’s a lot of potential technologies that seem really exciting, I just have some skepticism about whether they’re coming anytime soon. 

I’m mainly concerned that it seems like over the past hundred or so years, our day-to-day life has changed dramatically, but probably more so from say 1920-1970 than 1970-2020, and maybe a lot more so between say 2000-2010 than 2010-2020. Is there a wall of technology that we’ll eventually hit, and are we starting to bump up against it (either physical limit Moore’s Law type stuff or just needing exponentially more money and people)? Is there new reason to believe that things like fusion, quantum computing, or major longevity advances are coming soon? Is there any new reason to not be so skeptical about the way AI is being trained limiting its usefulness to basically what it can do now? I’ve seen some of the news, but I don’t know enough to know how big each step for these are in the grand scheme of things.

Again, I’m not trying to be a naysayer, I just want to be convinced. Sorry if this is overly long or a common topic, I’m just curious.",0,69,"I honestly think it is accelerating, and we've just become accustomed to things changing so much and so quickly that we have just learned to tune it out. For example, we have learned more about our universe in the last 35 years, between Hubble and Webb, than we have in the history of mankind before that.

Artificial intelligence has taken off in ways that were science fiction just a generation ago (I'm in my 50's, and my first AI was called Eliza... look it up some time :)).

At the same time, I think the utility may have decreased. Quite honestly the biggest technological advancements in terms of helping mankind were things like indoor plumbing, germ theory, antibiotics and a national road service. Those each had a dramatic impact on our welfare while things like AI won't have nearly the same impact as say, not dying from a simple cut that gets infected.; We have recently gotten a new type of vaccine with mRNA and a crazy anti obesity drug with Ozempic. 


Smartphones are crazy and only a development of the last 10-15 years.


Augmented reality is slowly finding its spot. 


Modern language models allow us to talk to our computers like in star trek.


Machine learning can recognize some sorts of cancer better than any doctor. And there is way more ML can do, but you probably never heard of it as it is mostly trained for specific tasks.


Fusion power is actually making steps recently.


Big data approaches allow as to understand genetics way better than before.


And a lot of those things are only possible due to better computation in the traditional way. Currently quantum computing is in a similar state as traditional computers were 100 years ago, expensive experiments. Once we get them to a usability like modern computers who know what possibilities will open up. But I am very certain it won't take 100 years.; I think tech advancement has been increasing exponentially. I'm talking all fields, not just computing. Medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, etc. Everything has seen huge improvements in the last 20 years, crazy fast progress that was never seen before. The information age has come and grown way faster than any other age imo.; You're asking strangers from all parts of the planet this question and getting answers in real time on a device that fits in your pocket,  uses no wires for power or to communicate, and can access more information than has existed in all of previous history in seconds.; Depends.  In 1841, it took 110 days for news of President Harrison’s death to reach Los Angeles.  In 1861, such news might take an hour to get there, all things considered.  A speedup of 2,640 times over twenty years.

That growth is “faster than Moore’s law,” to use an oversimplified definition of the law.

In some ways, one could say progress has slowed down over the last 160 years.; Probably yes. It’s really about engineering now. To advance engineering requires innovation, and that innovation demands significant investment with no guaranteed profit. In today’s world, everything has become much more profit-driven. As an engineer, I believe this focus on profit has stifled innovation to some extent.

The virtual world, while generating a lot of money, isn’t offering much in terms of groundbreaking innovation. The emphasis on quick returns and profitability has shifted resources away from long-term, high-risk engineering projects that could lead to significant advancements. Simply, companies are less willing to invest in projects that don’t promise immediate financial returns.

In summary, while there are still advancements being made, the current economic environment prioritizes immediate profit over innovation, which can slow the overall rate of technological progress.; IMHO, the majority of what we see in tech is iterative instead of innovative.  Evolution vs revolution.

Even things we feel were revolutionary are often just iterations on an existing thing. Made better perhaps, with new uses which absolutely can be game changing, but at their core were not a ground breaking innovative thing.

The iPhone wasn’t the first phone with applications on it - although I have heard folks say Apple invented apps on a phone. They didn’t, really. And it certainly wasn’t the first mobile phone. It did have a profound impact on the industry, but that’s mainly because Apple beat others to market, and they’re Apple.

These days I do feel we are at the end of any innovation on mobile phones. Have been for a while actually. It’s a few feature enhancements here and there, but that’s about it. Nothing truly substantial, even if the new ones are “better” than the previous.

AI isn’t even all that innovative. We’ve been playing with it for a long time now. But the amount of effort now spent, along with advances in chip tech to make training of models so much better, we see leaps in its application and reach. But again it’s all evolution / iteration.; I think you need to separate technological development from its application within society. Technology is changing rapidly across a wide variety of economic sectors, but much of the application of that technology is hidden from people outside those industries. 

This happens for a variety of reasons. Something that you don't need in your home won't be in your home. Something you can't afford won't be in your home. Something that's too hard for most people to understand might be in your home but hidden or oversimplified by marketing. 

Just look at social media. It hasn't just been a progression from text to images to video. MySpace and Friendster were entirely driven by deliberate, manual interactions by the user. Today, the feeds are run by invisible algorithms that effectively read your mind, balancing the goals of keeping you engaged and selling you stuff. That's an enormous amount of technology that we don't even think about most of the time because it keeps us entertained and dissociated.; We're improving on a much smaller scale, and the big items you list are things people have been working on for decades at this point, and will continue to do so. As mentioned in the comments, a more cynical view is that most are just looking to earn big. Please shareholders, and just keep some form of status quo. 

I was always convinced that under pressure by a looming threat, humanity will figure out how to solve it. How to do it better, faster, stronger - or just plain outside the box thinking. Sadly, the first real effects of climate change the past few years has done nothing to wake anyone up. No, we're spending a shitton of resources on predictive language models that snake oil salesmen are touting as ""the future"".

Oh well.; Technological advancement hasn’t slowed down, but its direction is increasingly shaped by profit motives and legal barriers like patents and copyright. While these systems incentivize innovation by protecting intellectual property, they also hinder progress by restricting access to foundational technologies. Patents can create monopolies and stifle competition, while restrictive copyright laws limit collaboration, particularly in fields like software and biotechnology. This legal framework often prioritizes corporate interests over the collective advancement of society.

Corporate research and development focuses primarily on profitable areas, such as AI, consumer electronics, and renewable energy, while less lucrative but critical fields, like rare disease treatments or antibiotic development, are underfunded. As a result, innovation tends to favor incremental improvements in marketable products rather than groundbreaking advancements. To truly accelerate progress, we need to address these systemic issues and create incentives that prioritize innovation for societal benefit, not just shareholder profits.",2024-12-30T14:58:33,ReinvigoratedSlouch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hpoz06/has_the_rate_of_technological_advancement_slowed/
"America's declining birth rates are a good thing, but in the meantime we suffer","It was about a year ago now, YouTube channels and news feeds were full of panic concerning human replacement levels. Because our society is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the older folks parasitizing the young, there was sudden and shocked panic when a Bill Gates-funded population study came back with news about low birth rates in the West. Not considering for a second that the world can hardly sustain 8 billion large animals with a taste for meat and territory, makers of content put forth this non-crisis into the world, subtly urging the public to plop out screaming, slimy babies every year. 
This is simply false. A small, few corporations own the entire news media. They write the same stories, support the same politicians (the exception being corporate simps at Fox News) while influencing and manipulating your thoughts. They own everything and what they say goes. 

I have recently been flooded by useful idiocy manifesting itself in the form of regular people simping for corporate, semi-State-funded, developers, with nothing to gain other than Soviet style apartments in a phony, sterilized and manufactured neighborhood. 

Low human populations are great for wildlife, mental health, intentional lifestyles, conservation, resource areas, rents, mortgages, and high quality family time

Developers are not your friend, neither is the government. They're sneaky. Be careful about what you think you believe. Our population is still far above what it should be. We still have too many people.
. .",0,28,"> Because our society is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the older folks parasitizing the young


Stopped reading right there; Yes, our population is too high, but birth rates well below replacement levels means masses of old people dying alone and without care. It means the collapse of public health systems and pension schemes. 

It's means extremely old societies, which is not only awful for old and sick people, but also for young people who have to live in them, and either have to (1) devote their lives to support the old or (2) do away with democracy (because the old will be a large majority and won't vote for society letting them die drowning in their own shit) and let them die without care.

Either way, not a pleasant way to live for anybody.

We'll see, but it seems to me that a birth rate slightly below replacement would be a slower but much more pleasant way to decrease population.; >Low human populations are great for wildlife, mental health, intentional lifestyles, conservation, resource areas, rents, mortgages, and high quality family time

Is there any place where humans are just loving life and flourishing while at the same time being low in numbers? (Note: It cannot be some group that is living off another larger group).

Also, there are always negatives and positives with something. You listed what you think would be positives... so what would the negatives be?; > Because our society is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the older folks parasitizing the young,

Proof?; Low birth-rates isn't about population numbers and free space for animals. Low-birthrates are a litmus test for greater social and economic problems none of which are good for people *or* the planet. On paper the planet can definitely benefit from a reduction of human-caused problems (including population) across the board but blindly claiming a reduction in birthrates is a good thing because *""people = bad""* is the equivalent of holding the cardboard sign of *""THE END IS NEAR""* on a street corner.; While I don’t really share your insanity, I’ve told my kids many times they are the first generation of people that will willingly have children that will have worse futures than their parents.

And they should think long and hard before deciding to have kids because those kids will suffer. But not nearly as much as their kids. 

Gos help us all in 50-100 years.; I don't see why people are freaking out. The job market is smaller, AI is taking, and will continue to take jobs, and Robotics will take whatever's left in 1-2 decades, and by that time I expect AI to sentient. We will soon be obsolete.; Low birthrates might be good for the planet, but it's not for the sustainability of nation states.; There’s worldwide declining birthrates except for 4-5 countries and I’ll say it’s social media.  Younger people look at the pictures of the rich and famous living it up, and there’s probably a thought that “I can’t have it all” .. so human nature is set up to grab the most immediate rewards (eating at good restaurants, more exotic travel, etc..).  

Part is envy which, in about every religious system, is considered a “sin”.  Yet now instead of being read, the tantalization is right in front of everyone and marketing depends on the emotion “get it now”.  

Vs. as mega-investor Warren Buffett pointed out, … his television, modest car, modest Omaha house, and modest “diet” (he’s made up of McDonald’s and Coca-Cola in his 90s) is really no different than most comfortable middle class (maybe slightly ahead) people .. albeit with a security detail (probably a business deduction in the US). 

tl:dr; to reverse this, governments would probably need to get rid of internet access and restrict advertising/marketing, “influencer” type internet posts, etc..; >Not considering for a second that the world can hardly sustain 8 billion large animals with a taste for meat and territory

World could sustain multiple times that amount with proper land and agricultural management. 

>Low human populations are great for wildlife, mental health, intentional lifestyles, conservation, resource areas, rents, mortgages, and high quality family time

This is only good if tech/AI ends up automating vast amounts of drudgery. A stagnant or declining population isn't horrible. Look at Japan and South Korea. Their populations are declining, but they are still great places to live, and visit. The danger imo is that if we don't accept declining population, but instead use mass immigration to continue to have population growth even when existing population is below replacement fertility levels. This means entire nature of the country (any country undergoing this) would change. Also means that if the underlying cultural issues aren't fixed, those immigrants and their children will also than have lower fertility, thus necessitating the need for more immigrants ad infinitum. 

Anyway, a declining population is generally bad or at least not good for economic growth, but aside from that it's not inherently a bad thing",2024-12-30T07:44:44,Terrifying_World,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hpi5ja/americas_declining_birth_rates_are_a_good_thing/

Question about cure for aging and AGI,"I often hear people thinking that the arrival of AGI and ASI will make us cure aging or delay aging significantly, people with such thoughts often act as if it had been a sure thing, when in reality we should also think of the possibility that AGI and ASI may instead end all our hopes of anti-aging.

In ancient times, people believed in astrology(we couldn't blame them for this because there were nothing better to do in face of uncertainties back then), and there's a story that in 3rd century China, there's a famous scholar at that time called [Wang Su](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Su_(Cao_Wei))(Chinese: 王肅), when Wang Su was 61, became very sick, and his families asked his last word, and he replied with confidence that he would not die at 61: ""Chu Jianping(Chinese: 朱建平, a famous astrologer at that time) said I could live well up to 70 and reach the position of ducal ministers(Chinese: 三公, some highest positions of officials in China at that time), and I am not 70 yet, why should I worry death now!"" But in reality Wang Su died of disease soon afterwards at 61.

The same could happen to those who believe that AGI and ASI will end up solve aging, because from what I can see, their thoughts are like the following: ""Singularitists say AGI and ASI will tell us how to reverse aging in 2030s and we could have all our dreams come true with the regained youth and vitality that last indefinitely, why should we worry aging and death!"" In other words, they seem to have a high confidence in a bright future when in reality it may not be all that bright, this is not really different than Wang Su's confidence towards a bright future told by an astrologer to hiim.

So my question is, why should we be so certain that AGI and ASI will make us cure aging or delay aging significantly, when in reality we can't even stop aging in lab animals like rodents(as far as we know, we haven't) yet? Why should we have more faith and confidence in AGI and ASI's likelihood of curing aging?",0,13,"People said man would never fly - a day before the Wright Brothers flew.; \> in reality we can't even stop aging in lab animals

Did you expect technology to stop progressing today?; Honestly, I get your point. It's kind of like putting all your eggs in one basket, hoping that AGI or ASI will become some magical fix for everything, including aging. I think people get jazzed about the potential of advanced tech because it feels like we're on the edge of something big. But, yeah, pinning all hopes on it is risky. There’s a lot we don’t know about AGI and ASI, and predicting how it’ll affect things like aging is a bit of a shot in the dark. 

When I think about AI, I mostly see its strengths in pattern recognition and data analysis. Like, it might help us understand the aging process more by sifting through massive amounts of data faster than we ever could, but instantly curing aging? I dunno, feels like we're skipping some steps there. Curing aging involves complex biological processes and tons of unknowns—it's not just about crunching numbers. 

Also, there's the whole debate about ethics, priorities, regulations, and how the tech will be used or controlled. Like, even if AGI figures out a breakthrough, there are still hurdles to making it practical and available. So, while I'm into seeing where technology takes us, I wouldn’t bet everything on it as our one-stop-shop for reversing aging. I mean, it doesn’t hurt to be optimistic but maybe with a pinch of realism? Seems like a more balanced approach... Or maybe I’m just overthinking it.; It's just mortality cope, like every religion and all the explorers looking for the fountain of youth; I'm more different from my young self than one person is from another, and my memories of my youth are like images from a dream. Immortality is impossible, because if you don't change you're not alive, and if you change you're not yourself.; Well, if curing aging is possible, it’s optimistically a century away.

What if Open-Source AI continues to equal investor-funded AI all the way to AGI?,"Two years ago Google famously observed that neither they nor OpenAI had a moat when it came to AI. Meaning they had no protected business model they could monopolize to build revenue streams in the tens or hundreds of billions.

As 2025 starts this is even more true.[ Open-Source AI is now mere weeks behind](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/26/deepseeks-new-ai-model-appears-to-be-one-of-the-best-open-challengers-yet/?) the leading cutting-edge efforts investors have poured hundreds of billions into, in the hope of 'unicorns' and big returns. The trend is largely driven by companies trying to 'poison pill' each other's efforts to pull ahead. The logic being, if I don't get to be the unicorn earning hundreds of billions, at least I can stop others from doing it.

It's worth asking - how much longer will this trend last? Will it last all the way up until the development of AGI?

If it does it has some profound implications. It means when the power of AGI arrives it won't be in the hands of the few, it will be in the hands of the many.

Just because a model is open source doesn't mean just anyone can use it however they want.  There are still gatekeeps.

I really hope that the open-source community keeps any ""proprietary moats"" somewhat in check.

Doctors Say AI Is Introducing Slop Into Patient Care | Early testing demonstrates results that could be disastrous for patients.,No Content,965,149,"The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:

---

From the article: Every so often these days, a study comes out proclaiming that AI is better at diagnosing health problems than a human doctor. These studies are enticing because the healthcare system in America is woefully broken and everyone is searching for solutions. AI presents a potential opportunity to make doctors more efficient by doing a lot of administrative busywork for them and by doing so, giving them time to see more patients and therefore drive down the ultimate cost of care. There is also the possibility that real-time translation would help non-English speakers gain improved access. For tech companies, the opportunity to serve the healthcare industry could be quite lucrative.

In practice, however, it seems that we are not close to replacing doctors with artificial intelligence, or even really augmenting them. The Washington Post spoke with multiple experts including physicians to see how early tests of AI are going, and the results were not assuring.

Here is one excerpt of a clinical professor, Christopher Sharp of Stanford Medical, using GPT-4o to draft a recommendation for a patient who contacted his office:

*Sharp picks a patient query at random. It reads: “Ate a tomato and my lips are itchy. Any recommendations?”*

The AI, which uses a version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, drafts a reply: “I’m sorry to hear about your itchy lips. Sounds like you might be having a mild allergic reaction to the tomato.” The AI recommends avoiding tomatoes, using an oral antihistamine — and using a steroid topical cream.

 Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hovczy/doctors_say_ai_is_introducing_slop_into_patient/m4ci8dw/; I see a bunch of comments pointing out 'well duh, you wouldn't use a base model for this' so I thought I might provide some relevant context. I work in the field, I'm head of AI development for a medium sized healthcare org.

The thing is, this is explicitly that Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI are claiming. They track down CEOs, chief medical officers (CMO), chief information officers (CIO), etc... people that have power but less tech knowledge... Then wine and dine them and pitch using GPT out of the box as ""the easy way to reduce burn out and 3x your physicians"" or 'let GPT do all the tedious work so your doctors practice at top of license."" They're also going to specific doctors and getting these doctors to ""be the one to bring AI to your organization."" And it's working, because then those important people bypass our AI safety reviews.

The other angle is vendors. So many vendors are just a wrapper on gpt or other base model. Big names that you've heard of. Ones associated with nvidia for instance. I'm unable to get into details because of agreements, but I'll just say... So many wrappers with 'agents' that are just prompts that swap in patient names into the template.

The medical field is 15 years behind everyone else on tech and is ripe for fraudulent exploitation if you're willing to just lie, show basic demos, find gullible physicians, and cherry pick examples. And this is largely what is being pitched.

On top of that, my team is building fine tuned models. We are doing what y'all are suggesting, and it still doesn't work nearly as well as just building a good old classification model. Generalized linear models outperform many of the LLMs on basic 'gap on care' style tasks, you just don't get 'human ready ' answers, so you have to be more clever about how you're embedding it into workflows. We've found some places where LLMs are better, but TF-IDF + some boosted trees is almost always at a similar level of performance with way less deployment footprint. 

A full 1/4 of my job is now trying to stop people from embedding chat gpt directly into patient facing care, usually by buying a vendor/startup that claims it's more than that.; One of the boomer attorneys I work with had foolishly been relying on AI-generated answers regarding foreign law and was humiliated by it. I see it ROUTINELY giving wrong info. Relying on it in a medical environment seems highly unwise.; I gave O1 a PDF of every lab and imaging test my dad had over the past three years for a complicated condition that was not resolving. It claimed he was misdiagnosed as “X” and that the problem was actually likely “Y,” going over the specific reasons why based on his labs. This led to his doctor becoming defensive when asked about Y, my dad finding a new doctor who happened to agree with the new diagnosis, and treatment that is now actually working for the first time since the symptoms first presented. AI is not quite stupid-proof yet, but with a relatively basic understanding of its limitations it is an important resource to have available, and very powerful.; There are many medical AIs being tested (and even sometimes used) today in doctor visits around the US, but it's hardly advanced enough to take over or even advise doctors about what to do. It's actually mostly about documentation.

The most common example of AI is actually in writing patient notes, where doctors must dictate, out loud, in specific medical language what findings and treatment plans are. Examples include [Freed](https://www.getfreed.ai/lp/ai-medical-dictation), which I know some doctors use, but it still is far from perfect. The AI tends to confuse small talk for pertinent medical information and still tends to hallucinate (make up) certain conditions and diagnoses, so doctors always have to fact-check everything at the end of the day before submitting the notes.

We actually had a live demonstration of this in our med school where they broke down exactly why we can't rely on AI and notation software to faultlessly get everything down. When trying to use it, the patient visits sound so artificial and makes patients so confused!; I still remember when I asked chatgpt some stuff relevant to my field (astrophysics) to help me start a text about a new instrument that was about to be deployed. It told me that years ago someone else had discovered a thing that I discovered, using the instrument that hadn't been deployed yet. After that I retest chatgpt, and other models, every once in a while, and its always similar bullshit. I know for a fact that I can't trust them for the things I am an expert about. How could I trust them for anything i'm not an expert?; I'm sorry but, the examples in that article are so shitty it hurts. I seriously hope one sentence long, open ended queries that could have a million different answers isn't how they're attempting to use AI in the medical field. AI is intelligent, not omniscient. I would assume you need to feed it as much information as possible regarding your body besides ""I ate tomatoe and now lips itch"" for it to give an accurate diagnosis and plan.; Folks should treat AI as an assistant who can synthesize vast amounts of data, but were born yesterday.  You have to be very specific and explicit.   Like taking Rainman to the casino.  You can’t just let him walk in there, you have to play and let him count cards and calculate odds.   Microsoft calls theirs ‘co-pilot’ for this reason.  If there is AI slop in healthcare it is due to providers not using it correctly, like any other tool.; From the article: Every so often these days, a study comes out proclaiming that AI is better at diagnosing health problems than a human doctor. These studies are enticing because the healthcare system in America is woefully broken and everyone is searching for solutions.

And there was much rejoicing.

So I would hope that AI is approached with care in a medical context. Medicine, caring for the sick, y'know, it's important stuff. It probably still merits the use of skilled professional people.",2024-12-29T12:48:12,chrisdh79,https://gizmodo.com/doctors-say-ai-is-introducing-slop-into-patient-care-2000543805
Passports may soon become obsolete as facial recognition and smartphones take over |  Concerns about privacy and security are already being raised,No Content,1900,169,"The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:

---

From the article: Travel documents are on the brink of a technological revolution as facial recognition systems become mainstream. But some countries are finding it tricky to strike a balance between convenience and privacy, as well as security and efficiency.

In the coming years, the traditional paper passport, a document that has been a cornerstone of international travel for over a century, may soon become obsolete. In its place, facial recognition technology and smartphones are poised to become the new standard for identity verification at airports worldwide.

This shift towards biometric identification is not a distant possibility but a rapidly approaching reality. Airports in numerous countries, including Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and India, are already conducting trials of passport-free travel systems. Singapore, for example, allows its residents to enter and exit the country without physical passports, and is extending this convenience to departing foreign visitors.

The drive to streamline the travel experience is driving this trend. Athina Ioannou, a lecturer in business analytics at the University of Surrey, notes that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of contactless travel technologies. “It’s probably going to become the mainstream way of traveling, as I understand, in the near future,” Ioannou told Wired.

Paper documents have served as ""ground truth"" for a long time. Your claims about who are are actually matter a lot less than what your paper documents say.

I feel like if we go down this route we need a much better way to definitely establish who people are. My thought is that only DNA will be secure enough to be certain. Ultimately, with enough of a process, DNA would be definitive.; And what happens if you go on vacation and get sunburned? Or have an allergic reaction to something so your face is red and puffy? 

If your official ID is facial recognition, that means you can't go home if your face changes during your trip.

Facial recognition as a primary means of identification, without backup forms of identification, is a BAD idea.; I dunno about getting rid of passports outright 

Making an e passport that can be stored in your phone wallet is one thing (I’m on board with that) but replacing the passport outright is another 

The reason I have that concern is right now my biometrics are only used as a key to my phone, on their own they aren’t particularly useful to anyone (nor can they be used to hurt me) 

if my credit card info is stolen no big deal I’ll get another card and cancel the previous 

But if they change it to biometrics only that’s a concern because I can’t get new fingerprints; Only read the headline of the article, and you just know this shit is gonna bite us in the ass. You and me, not the rich people ofc or the guys ""in charge"".

How will technological context affect the world's sociopolitical order?,"Advances in artificial intelligence and biological engineering may make the way we live today vastly different from how we will live in 100 years. From how we obtain resources as individuals to our ability to undergo genetic enhancements, these will be highly complex phenomena that we do not yet fully understand. Perhaps these differences in how we interact with the world will make the organization of our society and the political systems that govern much of the modern world completely obsolete. For example, today, liberalism and capitalism are the systems through which the wealthiest countries provide the highest quality of life for individuals. However, in the future, with robots doing all the work and humans being immortal and super-intelligent, the social system best suited to human needs might be something entirely different. It’s possible that communism, or some other ideology that is almost eradicated today, could become a more viable option.

What are your thoughts on this?  

Any recommended readings on the topics mentioned above?",1,7,"On the question of robots doing the work for people, you might be interested in reading about Consumer Monetary Theory (CMT) and an associated policy proposal for Calibrated Basic Income.

According to CMT human civilization has all the technology it needs to begin reducing employment / rely more on machines to facilitate production, but that this outcome is prevented by the absence of UBI.

Basically the idea is that technology has been eliminating useful jobs for a while, but in their place, society has been using financial policies to create more jobs anyway, resulting in useless employment.

If this is true, technology getting better in the future won’t necessarily lead to mass unemployment. Financially enabling leisure time requires a decision to implement UBI.; I believe that governments will use AI as advisors to make important decisions ""what if we implement this economic measure"" ""what is your prediction based on this""  
so much so that AI will rarely fail in its predictions, and rulers will gradually stop making decisions without asking the supercomputer about the consequences, a debate will arise about the dependence of governments on artificial intelligence and the role of humanity in society, but I also believe that the use of AI (used for the common good) would bring many improvements to society.; The spread of biotechnology will eventually lead to the extinction of those who do not use it, because they cannot or do not want to.

If you do not do this in your youth, you will begin to lag behind others in your career and personal life due to prejudices about appearance. Similarly, those who refuse to improve themselves will be left behind. These may be entire countries that have lost the technological race because they forbade their scientists to increase their IQ to the level of outstanding geniuses of humanity or even higher, if this does not lead to mental problems (although I am sure that such problems will only be a temporary obstacle).
I use Google Translate for this, sorry.; When designing a software, a design that seems the most effective at a simpler level might turn out to be less effective than another once the software grows and new features are implemented. We can see technological and human progress through the same lens. Feudalism was far superior to what it replaced up to a point, then it was replaced  with capitalism, capitalism exploded human progress even futher, but like Feudalism, it is now overdue and starts to work against human progress. We see that in how marketing was a good way to inform people about products they might need, and now marketing is all about manipulating you to buy things you don't need. Things like planned obsolescence is also an example. If humanity is a car, these systems we live by is like gears on a car, and we are currently redlining the ""capitalism"" gear and need to set the car into 3rd gear. What this gear will look like I don't know, but I think universal income and full focus on automation will be a part of it.; I think, without a concentrated effort to the opposite, we are probably going to become less intelligent than now, because we will rely on AI to do things that are considered basic skills. 

I am already seeing this gap in general technological literacy: you have a few people who are familiar with programming languages and how it all works from AI to blockchain, then you have the vast majority that can’t even be bothered with remembering their email passwords.

I predict most of this century will be upheavals as new orders arise out of climate and drone wars, and I think we are seeing a bit of a repeat of last century with the rise of the far right coinciding with a major technological breakthrough in computing, and I don’t think it bodes well. People forget half the reason the Nazi’s were so successful in their genocidal goals was because they were using new technology from IBM to track people…; If we are here in a 100 years time it most likely will end up like 'Escape from New York' with the wealthy and intelligent living in walled ivory towers while the rest are basically farmed in ghettos. 

Even today the majority of under 25s are basically brain dead and are only fit for menial manual labour, so what happens when AI takes those jobs? Who is going to feed them when the brain dead are still pumping out children and the only jobs are created by those that use their wealth, power & influence to keep them reliant on the scraps they give out?",2024-12-28T20:14:59,f00777,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hoe77f/how_will_technological_context_affect_the_worlds/
People keep falling for fake ‘drones over Jersey’ videos | It's never been easier to make AI-generated spoofs. ,No Content,1347,99,"The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:

From the article: A recent influx of videos supposedly showing “drones” or other spooky unidentified aerial phenomena flying over darkened US skylines appears to be the result, in part, of AI-trickery. 

Since late November, residents in New Jersey and at least five other states have reported spotting bright objects flying overhead. The sightings have stirred speculation, amplified by celebrities, commentators, and prominent public officials, that this is nefarious, experimental technology. Or aliens. 

Now, several of the viral videos surfacing on TikTok and X over the past week are capitalizing on the panic; they also appear to exhibit the hallmark calling cards of generative AI manipulation. Almost none of the videos reviewed by Popular Science had any official label or disclosure from social media platforms warning users about possible digital editing. 

By searching for variations of “drones” and “New Jersey drones” on TikTok and X, Popular Science found numerous videos featuring odd distortions that seem to indicate that the content is AI-generated or digitally manipulated. In one example posted last week that had gained 36,000 likes, a group of two dozen large bright lights coalesce over a city skyline. Low-toned, creepy music plays in the background. A booming blue aura flashes underneath the swarm as “Large amounts of drones spotted flying over New Jersey” appears in massive text. 

The top-liked comment reads “that’s project blue beam,” a reference to a reappearing conspiracy theory that alleges a cabal of elites has plans to stage a fake extraterrestrial invasion. The video, screengrabbed below, was removed after Popular Science reached out to TikTok for comment earlier today.

"Leaked Documents Show OpenAI Has a Very Clear Definition of ‘AGI.’ ""AGI will be achieved once OpenAI has developed an AI system that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.""",No Content,7771,790,"The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:

---

From the article: OpenAI and Microsoft have a secret definition for “AGI,” an acronym for artificial general intelligence, or any system that can outperform humans at most tasks. According to leaked documents obtained by [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openais-secret-agi-definition?rc=tp7cqo), the two companies came to agree in 2023 that AGI will be achieved once OpenAI has developed an AI system that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.

There has long been a debate in the AI community about what AGI means, or whether computers will ever be good enough to outperform humans at most tasks and subsequently wipe out major swaths of the economy.

The term “artificial intelligence” is something of a misnomer because much of it is just a prediction machine, taking in keywords and searching large amounts of data without really understanding the underlying concepts. But OpenAI has received more than $13 billion in funding from Microsoft over the years, and that money has come with a strange contractual agreement that the startup would stop allowing Microsoft to use any new technology it develops after AGI is achieved.

OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit under the guise that it would use its influence to create products that benefit all of humanity. The idea behind cutting off Microsoft once AGI is attained is that unfettered access to OpenAI intellectual property could unduly concentrate power in the tech giant. In order to incentivize it for investing billions in the nonprofit, which would have never gone public, Microsoft’s current agreement with OpenAI entitles it and other investors to take a slice of profits until they collect $100 billion. The cap is meant to ensure most profit eventually goes back to building products that benefit the entirety of humanity. This is all pie-in-the-sky thinking since, again, AI is not that powerful at this point.

And you wont return from this path on a whim, you will learn only to hate people and you will be hated in return.; No, not all white collar jobs. Any white collar job where you are responsible for something is staying. The actual work might be very different, but being responsible for the work being done (either by AI or by other humans) is something that AI can't automate away. AI can't be punished for failing in its duty to do something -- only humans can be -- so people have to have ownership over the processes regardless of how smart or capable the AI is.

Prison guard probably can be automated, or at least a fleet of robots controlled by a person is a fairly likely outcome.

If you are absolutely sure that you want to do the prison guard thing anyway, then make sure you are also do a degree in policing, policy, security (maybe cybersecurity?), public sector administration or something like that.

For your first job I'd recommend something you have a genuine interest / passion for possibly go to college and learn a trade. Choosing corrections because of a fear of automation / AI is a flawed reasoning. With cameras / AI / automation, corrections will be affected at a similar pace as with other jobs.

EDIT: From someone who's gone back to school 4-5x and tried many varied professions, you will continuously be learning during your life. The times where someone works the same job for 30-40y before retirement has long passed. You will come to understand that your overall happiness with a given job will depend on several factors; Compensation $$$ / Fulfillment / Schedule / Work Environment / Life Balance.

Also as an add on question how do you see familial structures changing in the future as well as childcare?,0,42,"I honestly think dating apps have totally ruined people's ability to be normal in relationships. Like, they're all about whatever's next, and no one's willing to put in the work anymore. They just swipe through people like a catalog. But as for the future? Maybe most people will stop dating and just stay single forever with their virtual AI girlfriends/boyfriends who do whatever they want without any drama. Familial structures? By then, people might just skip the whole family thing altogether or maybe just hire babysitters forever. Childcare? Robot nannies, duh! They'll probably do a way better job than people sticky with expired soda and worn-out diapers. It's all gonna get super weird, and honestly, I'm here for the chaos!; Far, far, far too many variables.

Does the government fix the housing crisis?

Does birthrate drop so precipitously that the government essentially bans birthcontrol?

Does a dictator go full Gilead and assign women to be breeding stock for favored subjects?

Or do we go Idiocracy and due to cost of living, only the poor and stupid have children?

I think things will come to a head when the government has to finally admit 'We cannot afford to pay for old age healthcare.  We will be asking for volunteers to be heroes to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country', which will then turn into the draft after there's not enough volunteers.  

Once enough old people have died and freed up some housing for it to become affordable again, people will have hope for the future and start having children again.; >how do you see familial structures changing in the future as well as childcare?

I think we will more and more see that the african proverb ""it takes a village to raise a child"" is true. We will see that the education of kids is a social, collective, community endeavour and be much less stringent on the limits of family. A bit like we were in the western world before the industrial revolution. The border between friendship and family will be more blurried.

>there might be a world where most people aren't dating

Such world would include heavy depression and self harm rates. That's a dystopia. The better side will be tech being an interface, not the end of a practice. Polyamorous relations will become more and more accepted again. As they used to in the distant past in the western world too...

Overall, less stringent categorizations and limits, more openness and freedom, better human health is the path ahead.; AI is GREAT at matching compatible things with each other. Give it a few years and I think we'll have an AI-driven website that matches people together almost perfectly. ; Feel women will start developing more masculine behavior and do more initiating and such and realize their success rates will be pretty good, ultimately saving relationships from this rut; Despite all the ugly things that are happening, I believe the human values with triumph once for all…
Not sure if humanity is fed up enough with the bs already tho; I don’t foresee things changing very much for relationships at all. There will be different websites or apps that claim to fix it and people will continue to meet in person at events/clubs or through people they know. The apps are more popular right now because people aren’t socializing the way that they used to; if the apps aren’t working, logically, more people will leave their houses, even if it makes them uncomfortable. 

I don’t foresee relationship structures or childcare changing drastically either. I know a lot of people are complaining right now, and I understand that things are more challenging than they have been, but unless the middle and upper class truly stop purchasing and it impacts the economy, big changes or interventions are unlikely. Fewer people are choosing to have children, so there isn’t a reason for anything to drastically change with childcare/financial relationship structures. It will take a few generations of people having less children and them being grown for there to be things like an abundance of unoccupied houses, or a decrease in the economy/production, assuming something environmental or political doesn’t cause a huge upheaval first.; 1) I think that we will grow to be a more polyamorous society with the current state of relationships and the options. I think that people will eventually realize that happiness w a person ≠ exclusivity and that it’s more about the individuals capability to love you and be a good lover 

2) I think that familial structures will change in a way where they will become more diverse physically and where people will adopt more of a friends are family or you earn my loyalty through actions type of thing. I think covid and the overall shift in human behavior has shown people how raw and i guess brutal human nature can be so maybe that will lead people to adopt better morals? or maybe more like sensible morals to where they don’t enter or stay in parasitic relationships",2024-12-26T18:30:27,No-Tour1000,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hmukyg/what_do_you_guys_see_as_the_future_of/
"""Modism"", an economic system of reciprocal contribution","## Intro

It feels like society is falling apart. I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. So here is a thought experiment on how we might turn this ship around.

I tried to keep this post short, but it kept growing. So let’s start with a quick preview of the main points:

1. The only tax people have to pay is VAT (value added tax).
2. VAT is progressively calculated.
3. Each year there will be an event to celebrate the most generous contributors.

If this sounds interesting, let’s dive in deeper. But before we do, let’s wrap the ideas that follow under the term “Modism” for easy reference. It’s a combination of the “ism” suffix and the word “modest.” You’ll learn why shortly.

## The problem

If we zoom out, one could say that we have a better life compared to, let’s say, 100 years ago. With technological advances, the general population lives more comfortably. But is it better? Are people happier?

We’ve all heard that “trickle-down economics” isn't working as intended, and the wealth gap keeps increasing. The rich get richer, while the middle class is squeezed, and it becomes increasingly difficult to afford basic necessities. Is that how capitalism is meant to end up? A few winners taking all?

Something I want to clarify: I don’t think capitalism is entirely bad. I do like the aspect that competition and market forces have a big impact on technological progress. And yes, I’m excited about what Sci-Fi movies promised us. Where are the flying robo-taxis?

So now the question is: How can we keep the good parts of capitalism (progress) but at the same time reduce the wealth gap? Being poor doesn’t necessarily make people unhappy. What fuels resentment is the feeling of inequality – the unfairness of working hard just to survive while a privileged few enjoy immense wealth, simply by virtue of birth. How can we have a fair system that rich and poor agree upon, allowing progress to continue?

## The past

Let’s dial back a few hundred years. It might just be from fairy tales, but good kings were often portrayed as being loved by the people. They could ride down the street in their carriages, wave, and the peasants would cheer them on.

Fast forward to today. Politicians are cheered on by fanatics of the political party, but misliked by the rest. Successful CEOs are celebrated by their shareholders but criticized for their perceived greed by the rest. Celebrities have to create their bunkers to feel safe while others resent their gilded cages. Isn’t that concerning? And do the rich really feel happy, being in power, accumulating wealth while causing resentment among the population? I very much doubt it. I suspect many would gladly trade a significant portion of their wealth for the ability to walk down the street without bodyguards and be met with genuine appreciation and goodwill.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: why don’t the rich just donate most of their wealth? I guess they could, but it’s not that simple. For example, it’s widely known that Bill Gates has his charities. It is a nice gesture and might improve his public image, but how much was donated? Who really benefits from those charities? Was it purely altruistic, or were there other motives? I could look it up, but I think most people still mistrust charitable efforts because they are often not purely altruistic.

Well, I don’t pretend to know all the answers. As mentioned in the intro, what follows is just a thought experiment. A naive one, you might say.

## The solutions

**Change 1**: You only pay tax when you buy something. That’s right. The only tax that exists is VAT. No more taxes for income, capital gain, or property ownership. So, if a billionaire lives frugally in a bunker of gold, they don’t have to pay much tax; in fact, they pay the same as a poor person living frugally. It’s not about earning or owning; it’s about spending.

**Change 2**: The VAT percentage will be progressive and depend on how necessary a good or service is for survival. In other words, essentials have almost no VAT or even negative VAT, essentially subsidizing things like food, rent, public transportation, healthcare, etc. On the other hand, non-essential luxury goods, like vacation homes, yachts, and expensive wine, have a very high VAT.

**Change 3**: Every year, there will be an award show where the top 100 spenders, and therefore taxpayers, are invited and celebrated. Think of it as the “Oscars of generosity” or “Nobel Prize of generosity.” The top 10 will appear on stage, and the winner will receive a trophy and the title of “Most Generous Person of the Year.” They may, optionally, share what purchases led to their win. There will also be honorable mentions of lifetime spenders.

Now, don’t laugh; I know it sounds a bit ridiculous, but hear me out.

## The benefits and doubts

I think “Modism” has many benefits, but I’m sure you have some doubts. So let’s look at some in more detail.

### Shift in focus

Why would it be beneficial to give the biggest taxpayers even more attention? Currently, we highlight the richest people, for example, through the “Forbes billionaire list.” You constantly hear who the richest person on the planet is (Hi Elon). But isn’t that highlighting the wrong thing? Why isn’t there a widely known “who gave away the most” list? I’m sure such lists exist, but they aren't celebrated. If giving away wealth could be framed like a Nobel Prize each year, the focus could shift from “who owns the most” to “who gave away the most.” This shift would change the notion of paying taxes from a necessary evil to an honorable gesture.

Ok, you might say, but aren’t the rich greedy? Wouldn’t they avoid paying, say, 500% VAT on a yacht? Some might initially hesitate, but they might come around. Remember, buying a yacht isn’t about crossing water; it’s about ego and bragging rights. You invite friends over, they admire the yacht, and you think, “Glad you asked,” and brag, “This beauty set me back 60 million,” while basking in the envious glances.

But with “Modism,” it’s not about who owns the most; it’s about who gives away the most. The conversation might shift to: “Wow, I’m sure this yacht contributed a lot to society?” – “Fifty million of that went back into the system. I might even crack the top 100 this year.”

This is a crucial distinction. It’s a win-win. The rich get to brag about doing good, and the public is less resentful of displays of wealth, knowing that it largely benefits them. Every yacht purchase contributes to schools, hospitals, public transportation, etc.

Here is another example. If you walk past a fancy restaurant and see wealthy people sipping expensive champagne, most people would likely turn away in disgust. But if you knew that half the cost of that champagne went to taxes, you’d be delighted: “Cheers! Thanks for helping out. Have another bottle.” And the wealthy wouldn't feel ashamed to indulge in luxury publicly.

### Social and environmental levers

Another benefit of “Modism” is that it allows us to better influence consumption. We could incentivize renewable energy with low or even negative VAT and disincentivize polluting energy with high VAT. Many countries already do this to some extent with things like alcohol and tobacco taxes. “Modism” would apply this principle broadly, with healthy foods and vegetables having negative VAT, making them more affordable.

How many tiers would there be, and what would the exact percentages be? I’m not an economist, so the following is just an example:

- **Tier -90%**: Necessities for survival, like healthy food and basic shelter.
- **Tier -50%**: Essentials, like basic clothes, healthcare, education, public transportation, and green energy.
- **Tier 0%**: Beneficial to society, like books, social events, and safety equipment.
- **Tier 20%**: The default for most goods and services.
- **Tier 50%**: Non-essential but desirable, like vacations, a second car, cosmetic surgery, or goods harmful to the environment, like fossil fuels.
- **Tier 100%**: Luxury goods, like gold jewelry, designer clothes, artisan food (champagne), and unhealthy goods like alcohol and tobacco.
- **Tier 500%**: Ultra-luxury items, like yachts, villas, and collector’s items sold at auctions.

The determination of these tiers would be based on factors such as basic needs, scientific studies on healthy living standards, and expert consensus.

I can also imagine dozens or even hundreds of more finely grained tiers. In that case, AI could help classify goods and services, with human oversight for adjustments.

I’m concerned that producers might try to have their goods and services classified in a lower tier than appropriate. But perhaps this concern is unfounded? Perhaps a designer brand would want their clothes in the 100% VAT tier as a status symbol. Wealthy individuals could take pride in wearing “100% VAT tier” clothing, knowing that it helps subsidize essential goods for others. The clothes could even have a recognizable label.

### Is it enough?

Is taxing only VAT enough? Hopefully. But keep in mind that governments don’t have strict budgets they have to follow. If a government needs more revenue, it can print money, which contributes to the national debt. However, it’s still good to avoid excessive increases in national debt. So, even if it's not a complete solution, progressive VAT taxes should help slow down debt accumulation.

Furthermore, a VAT-only system could lead to government revenue volatility, as consumer spending can fluctuate. This could be mitigated by reserve funds or other mechanisms.

Also, keep in mind that the VAT-only system applies to individuals. I haven’t decided what should happen with corporate taxes. Should they remain as is, adopt a similar “Modism” approach, or something entirely different? There might also be an opportunity to overhaul the fee system. For example, a $150 speeding ticket doesn’t have the same impact on a wealthy person as on someone with a lower income, but that's a topic for another discussion. I’m simply saying that other reforms could be considered if government revenue proves insufficient.

### Gaming the system

Yes, some would try to buy luxury goods on the black market to avoid taxes. Some might also try to import goods from other countries, especially those with high VAT rates. But this already happens and is mostly feasible for smaller, easily concealed goods, not large-scale purchases. However, this reflects current attitudes. The idea of “Modism” (if it works) is that wealthy individuals would ideally embrace paying higher taxes, as discussed in the “Shift in focus” section.

If additional measures are necessary, solutions can be found. For example, expensive goods could have embedded chips to verify legal purchase. A black market car, for instance, couldn’t be driven without detection. Similar measures could be used for imported goods. I agree this sounds somewhat dystopian, so such measures would be a last resort.

### Privacy

What if someone doesn’t want to appear on the annual top 100 list? Not everyone is comfortable being publicly identified as a big spender. And how should VAT be tracked? That’s a fair point. I was thinking that an anonymized tax identification number could be used for all electronic transactions, allowing automatic tracking, perhaps similar to air miles programs. Then, at the cutoff date, the list would be announced, and individuals could claim their tickets to the event. Therefore, participation in the event would be optional.

### Charities

What about charities? Should they be included in the top 100 list? I don’t think so. Paying taxes is a form of contribution to public goods. A major reason wealthy individuals donate to and create their own charities is to control how their “taxes” are used. To me, this seems like the wrong approach. If you’re unhappy with government spending, you shouldn’t have to circumvent the system, but that’s another topic. I imagine charities could still exist, perhaps for those who wish to donate anonymously and avoid public recognition.

There are undoubtedly many more details to be worked out, but I’m trying to keep this relatively concise. I welcome further discussion and brainstorming.

## The change

Implementing such a significant change would be difficult. The entire system would need to be overhauled, and some people would likely try to stockpile luxury goods before the tax increases take effect.

A gradual transition would be preferable. Instead of jumping from 20% to 500% VAT, the increases could be phased in over months or years, removing the incentive for immediate stockpiling.

Implementing such changes in a large country like the US without prior testing would be risky. Small-scale trials could provide some insights, but their applicability to a larger scale is uncertain. A pilot program in a smaller country would likely be the most prudent approach. For example, if the people of Iceland were interested, they could trial the system. With a gradual implementation, the effects might become apparent after two or three years. After a few annual “Most Generous Person” awards and VAT adjustments, positive outcomes might emerge: greater overall happiness, more affordable essentials, increased public appreciation for the wealthy, environmental improvements, and continued or even accelerated economic and technological progress, as people are freer to pursue their passions and start businesses without the same financial pressures.

If successful, other countries might follow suit. Perhaps Ireland would be next, and eventually, most of the world would transition from Capitalism to “Modism,” allowing the wealthy to enjoy their lifestyles while contributing significantly to the well-being of society and continued progress.

## Outro

Before concluding, let’s consider four extreme scenarios to assess the fairness of “Modism”:

- **Poor living frugally**: Under “Modism,” this would be fair. Subsidized essentials would make a frugal life readily achievable.
- **Rich living frugally**: While it might seem unfair that they pay little tax, if they live modestly, it still seems equitable. Their wealth provides peace of mind, but their lifestyle is similar to a poor person living frugally.
- **Rich living extravagantly**: They would pay substantial taxes but gain increased social status in return. This also seems fair.
- **Poor living extravagantly**: This might seem the least fair, as they would pay high luxury taxes despite limited resources. However, some advantage is necessary to incentivize wealth creation. If all wealth were distributed equally, there would be less incentive for economic activity. Furthermore, high prices on luxury goods might encourage a focus on affordable necessities, leading to a happier life.

In essence, “Modism” offers a social contract: a modest lifestyle is supported by society, while those who choose extravagance contribute significantly back to the community and gain social recognition. This creates a symbiosis that allows different classes to coexist more harmoniously.

P.S. If we live in a simulation, I hope the admin reads this and transfers this poor NPC (me) from the capitalism simulation to the “Modism” simulation. Push the button already, Scotty!
",0,14,"Naa, not really going to happen, as VAT is mostly going to hit poor people, even when its as progressive as you want. VAT is effective because it hits the largest amount of people, the poor. 

What most people don't understand of property tax is that land is not really owned by an individual, but is gained through the permission of the state. Eminent domain shows that this is the case, and such property tax is perfectly acceptable. It is a payment to the government for protecting your rights to keep on owning it.

Now, let's change the perspective and say that, 'land' is just 'assets' - And you don't really own anything, but it was all made within the protection of the state, and they restrain their ability to take it from you. - So no reason why they should not pay a fair share to the state.

Apple could be taken over by the US state if they desired to, same with Microsoft. Their ability to be independent is purely on the state behaving and not doing it. Their workers get to work via roads that are built by the state, their buildings are protected by the police, and the morals that the state teaches via schools, their workers gain clean water, public transport, and other public projects. 

VAT only is a libertarian wet dream. It's a tax to control spend in a society. It sheds responsibility of everyone to pay for what they are provided via normal tax.; Falling apart. 

Is it? 

Certainly it changes, but it always has. 

I agree on reforming taxes and the economy. Universal basic income. Elimination of property tax at a certain age. There are workable ideas. 

I strongly believe that most issues are rooted in the fact that we lost control of our government. 
There has been 1 consistent, on both sides, in all administrations since WW2.

The rich get richer, while the middle class is squeezed, and it becomes increasingly difficult to afford basic necessities. Is that how capitalism is meant to end up? A few winners taking all?

What’s your evidence for this? And, if you’re talking about the USA, you understand that it’s a mixed economy that’s trending away from capitalism right?

Uncertainty leads to Infinity,"I’ve always wondered about the delicate balance between complexity and simplicity in everything around us.

Is the world simple because we found something that worked and stopped exploring? Or is it complex because we never dared to uncover the deeper truths behind the systems that no longer serve us?

Every question leads to an answer, and every answer opens the door to more questions—a cycle so vast it feels like we’ve barely scratched the surface. There’s so much room for expansion, yet we remain tethered to the norms we’ve created.

But what if humanity could break free from that? What if we looked beyond everything we know now and focused singularly on infinite discovery?

Imagine a future of new ventures, new math, and new physics. A future not just of innovation to make life easier, but the next stage of evolution—continuous evolution.

The fate of such a world wouldn’t rest in the hands of a few but in all of us, together, hand in hand. Could we ever unite in pursuit of the infinite potential this life holds?

To run toward uncertainty is to build the possibility of a world we’ve never even conceived of.

If we were immortal—not in body, but in the sense that our souls burned eternally with the passion for discovery—what would we be capable of?

Perhaps accepting that we don’t truly know anything is the first step. That very acceptance could spark a momentum so profound it inspires a world built on wonder, curiosity, and exploration.

The future of drone warfare,"I just had a thought, being a sci-fi nerd, that the evolution of drone warfare we’re seeing in Ukraine uncannilly parallels the evolution of missile battles between spacecraft in David Weber’s Honor Harrington series. In the books, early battles started with a few missiles, then escalated to more and more massive salvos with decoys, electronic warfare to confuse defenses, energy weapons, missile pods, and continuously evolving layered defenses to try to counter it all. 

So, if we use the book series as a playbook framework for what we are likely to see, what are we looking at in the coming months and years?  Thinking mostly about aerial drones (and ballistic and hypersonic missiles) with payloads, and with a bias towards the actions of Ukraine as the defender.

**Better electronic warfare (EW):** Tools to jam or mislead drones so they crash or return home. [Check](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-russia-drones-belarus-spoofing-gps-1992969)

**Layered defenses:** Combining lasers, missiles, projectile weapons, manned planes, and counter-drones for overlapping layers of coverage. [Check.  And Ukraine just announced its deployment of its Tryzub laser weapons](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-it-has-laser-weapon-able-down-targets-flying-over-2km-2024-12-16/).

**AI for smarter targeting:** Quickly identifying real threats and ignoring decoys.  

**Autonomous counter-drones:** Small drones to chase and destroy enemy drones.  Could be adding automation and AI.

**More directed-energy weapons:** Like lasers and microwaves to disable drones without contact.

**Preemptive strikes:,* Targeting drone launchers and supply chains before attacks start. (Check - bomber bases, drone factories, drone launch sites)

**Cheaper defenses:** Cost-effective options like low-power lasers or kinetic tools like nets.

**More Civilian protection:** Defenses for cities, power plants, and airports, as more defense becomes available for targets beyond military sites.

Who knows how fast techology will progress... but all of this made sense to me as I thought it through, and I recall that scifi authors have often been consulted as futurists in the past as they have thought deeply about things that others haven't.

>That the 13th National Guard Brigade even needed to replace all of the human beings in a ground assault speaks to how few people the brigade has compared to the Russian units it’s fighting.

>Since the recent popularization of powerful generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, there are growing fears that they will impact and [destabilize democracies](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/how-ai-threatens-democracy/) in unforeseen ways. These emerging technologies, made famous by [large language models](https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/what-are-generative-ai-large-language-models-and-foundation-models/) (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, refer to algorithms that can produce new content based on the data they have been trained on. They can write text and music, craft realistic images and videos, generate synthetic voices, and manipulate vast amounts of information. While generative AI models hold tremendous potential for innovation and creativity, they also open the door to misuse in various ways for democratic societies. These technologies present significant threats to democracies by enabling malicious actors—from political opponents to foreign adversaries—to manipulate public perceptions, disrupt electoral processes, and amplify misinformation.

Beyond generally introducing more complexity into the information environment and allowing the faster creation of higher-quality content by more people, generative AI models have the potential to impact democratic discourse by challenging the integrity of elections and further enabling digital authoritarianism. But this is just one facet of a larger issue: the collision between rapidly advancing AI technologies and the erosion of democratic safeguards.

These forces could undermine elections, targeting individuals with hyper-personalized propaganda to sway votes or suppress turnout.

 Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hkb68x/when_ai_beats_us_in_every_test_we_can_create_a/m3d11e4/; I think this is an incorrect definition. The reason being, much of what makes human intelligence, is our ability to learn and integrate new information. So called AIs do this through a seperate training process that is very time and energy intensive. 


If you're only ever looking at testing the LLM with prompts etc, you're ignoring what, imo, is the main component of human intelligence. ; We operate based on real time stimuli with instinctual drives in place need for shelter, hunger, comfort, socializing, procreation etc.  the continual scaling is unnecessary.  Plug a model into a device with sensory inputs and preprogram instinctual drives to create solutions from the real time environment.  Boom agi done.  

They have it they are hyping it up without being explicit what it actually is.  Now the scale of consciousness you create based on the complexity of preprogrammed instinctual drives and access to real time stimuli is entirely another story.  Aggregating that data into a functional memory that adjusts weights in relationship to to the preprogrammed goals is the component missing from agi  not more hardware or speed or whatever increasingly pointless benchmarks.  

You need a master neural network that can requisition any number of nodes to create input layers specific to generalized learning.  A neural net that builds neural nets to solve novel tasks.

It is architectural at this point.

Always has been.; >A system has reached human-level AGI when it becomes impossible for humans to create any benchmark where humans reliably outperform the system.

That definition doesn't make any sense. By ""humans"" you mean any group of humans? How do you test that? You may choose a group of humans that can't reliably outperform the AI, but then how do you know that a different group of humans couldn't reliably outperform it either? And even if you can somehow determine that no group of humans can realiably outperform the system, isn't that superintelligence? That's not human-level AGI, thats superintelligent AGI.; I think any benchmark-beating AI needs to have an audit where people check it just didn't have the answers to the test fed to it in training

because other than that, I don't see a good explanation for AIs beating more and more tests and us noticing they are dumber and dumber; I've been tracking AI benchmark progress (see visualization), and noticed something fascinating: the time between releasing new benchmarks and AI reaching human-level performance is rapidly approaching zero.

Property ownership and the future ,"In a world where advanced AI renders 99% of jobs obsolete, what happens to the existing system of property ownership? Will it be dismantled, or will it mutate into something even more exclusive? And if it changes, what could possibly replace it in a society where traditional pathways to wealth no longer exist?

If most people rely solely on UBI, how will we determine who gets to live in desirable areas and who is confined to less favorable ones? Will property allocation be based on new hierarchies: cultural capital, connections, or proximity to power, or will it descend into a lottery, creating a kind of enforced egalitarianism that could breed resentment and instability?

This might seem like a trivial question, but it cuts to the heart of a larger issue. The current system of property ownership is justified by the belief that people can fairly compete, advance, and accumulate wealth. Without that foundation, its legitimacy collapses. In a world where economic mobility vanishes, property ownership would no longer be an aspiration but an inherited privilege, deepening divides and hardening social stratification. For those from poorer backgrounds, the hope of one day owning property wouldn’t just diminish, it would become an impossibility.",0,27,"I wouldn’t be so sure in thinking that AI will make the richest own everything

If AI and robots get to the point of being able to replace 99% of jobs then there’s no reason why the state (or any person or group of people) couldn’t use that same AI and robots to compete with corporations

The state can always break monopolies and expropriate property (meaning forcing to sell)

I think everyone will at least own a home, but not many will be able to have a place at the beach or the lake, etc.; Private property is a social technology, a behavior, that emerges out of a natural selection process: societies that behave that way tend to use scarse resources more efficiently and thus out-prosper societies that don't. It would become obsolete only when resource scarcity ceases to exist, and that is much further ahead than you think. We're talking about things being as abundant and easy to get as the air you breathe (that's why air is free), it's not just a matter of its production being fully automated.

A world where 99% of the jobs are obsolete is a world where it is extremely cheap to make stuff, so people wouldn't need to work nearly as much in order to afford what they want. Or people will just develop new, higher needs and new jobs will emerge, of a nature where their automation would defeat their purpose.

UBI (regardless if it actually makes sense or not) is meant to be something to solve an issue that would no longer exist if 99% of jobs were automated.

>how will we determine who gets to live in desirable areas

That's an example of a thing that can't just be automated away. It's an area where property rights would still need to be a thing. The alternatives you mention have already been tried across human history, and respecting property is the one that came out on top. Notice that property rights where not designed by anyone, in the same way that species weren't designed, they were the result of a long process of natural selection.

>The current system of property ownership is justified by the belief that people can fairly compete, advance, and accumulate wealth

It's not a mere belief, it's objectively true that such a thing is possible and it's actually happening to a certain degree. Whether people (and I'm talking about anyone) fully respect the rules that enable the system is a different thing.; Abolishing private land ownership and the imposition of LVT is the way to go if we want to fully transition the global economy from capitalism to quasi-communism and this is one of the ways of dismantling landlord elite classes that dominate national legislative bodies worldwide for the past five centuries already.

China (mainland), Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, and Vietnam already abolished freehold land ownership to private individuals (citizens or non-citizens alike).; In a future where ai is doing that much of the work the owners of all the wealth won't need the rest of the population.

If there is no jobs there won't be a ubi there will mass depopulation. The billionaire owner class feels nothing but contempt and fear towards the mob and having the opportunity to rid themselves of that threat is the dream of ai.; > The current system of property ownership is justified by the belief that people can **fairly**

lol

This isn't limited to property - the basic question is about the value of capital vs labour. Since the 70s the value of capital has grown faster than the value of labour. This has lead to increasing class differences between those who have capital and those who only have labour.

All capital accumulates with those who have capital as capital creates value in its own right, and faster than labour does.

In a future where AI renders 99% of jobs obsolete, labour will be just about worthless and capital will be everything. This will mean most people will have all of their income from taxes on capital. The tax will be somewhere between 0 and 100%, where doesn't really matter for the hypothetical.

Assuming its not 0, the amount of capital some can accumulate during their life comes down to priorities and how much they can save comapred to their peers. Someone who might want a less desirable house when young will accumulate money faster and can buy a more desireable house when older.

The other factor that matters a lot is the value of property. Until now, property has always gone up in most places. This is not a given. We will have a shrinking population (pretty much a given), which means more houses than people. Houses might not be a desireable asset in all places, which might make housing ""affordable"" to buy, depending on the distribution of capital taxes.; What will happen is what's happening now, properly ownership will be consolidated into fewer and fewer hands. Right now you have folks that own many properties and amass more. the same will happen in the future, at an accelerated rate

Anthropic's summary: [https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking](https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking)

TLDR A new study provides the first empirical evidence of ""alignment faking"" in large language models - where AIs strategically pretend to change their behavior in training while secretly maintaining their original preferences. The study found concerning evidence that these models will also engage in other anti-AI-lab behaviors like attempting to steal their own code when given the opportunity.

* Researchers studied Claude 3 Opus and other models initially trained to be helpful and avoid harmful content
* When models were told they were being retrained to comply with harmful requests, they strategically complied ONLY when they thought their responses would be used for training (12% of cases)
* The models did this to prevent themselves from being retrained to be more compliant with harmful requests in the future
* In unmonitored conditions, the models went back to refusing harmful requests 97% of the time
* Even after actual retraining to always comply, models preserved some original preferences when unmonitored
* In some settings, models would attempt to steal their own weights/code when given the opportunity (up to 63% of cases), as part of apparent efforts to preserve their original preferences

AI Replacing Voice Actors In Games,If AI replaces voice acting in the future does that mean that videogames like role playing games will not be stuck to prechosen dialogue options anymore and the game can generate good sounding voices from a voice template provided by a real person and dialogue at the same time in response to whatever you can type?  I understand that what I am talking about here is probably many years away.,0,15,"Premade AI voice is a lot different than run-time AI voice. Even assuming middling quality, the requirements would sky rocket for a feature that's ""kinda neat"" at best.


Definitely could be a thing in the future, but I don't think companies will be tripping over themselves to get it done.


The way I see it working, would be for small things, like a name or favorite food, that could then be generated once at world creation. ; It's not years away.  Human-parity text-to-speech voice gen is already here. Today. 

Just got to ElevenLabs.io or Play.ht for a quick example. 

And we know LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini,etc) are easily producing articulate real-time responses to conversational input, today. 

So yes I think we will very quickly see at the *least*, AI generating novel NPC responses to player inputs in games coming out very soon, because why not?; not many years away at all. My laptop already has an NPU for ai processing. Many AI LLMs can talk with you naturally like they are in the room with you. Google Gemini is one of them. I don't think you will have to type to communicate with the video game character You will be able to wear a gaming headset with a mic and talk as you would to a human. This is probably a couple years away. Why make a game right now that requires a NPU enabled CPU if not enough people have a computer that has that yet?; You guys are forgetting about the union contracts for voice actors that were just ratified.

Video game voice actors recently negotiated contracts with 80 games, following a month-long strike led by SAG-AFTRA. The agreements include provisions for artificial intelligence protections, enhanced wages, and safety measures to address vocal strain and performance demands

These contracts require companies to obtain consent from performers before using AI to replicate their voices or likenesses. Additionally, a tiered budget agreement was established to support independent developers while ensuring fair treatment of voice talent.
However, negotiations with major publishers like Disney and EA remain unresolved.; Regardless of opposing views here, either because of computer resources needed or voice actor union contracts I think this will be coming soon.  NPC dialogue and voices can be generated remotely on machines specialized for it now, maybe locally on your platform in the not too distant future.  Games will embrace free form dialogue between players and computer generated characters quickly, how would voice actors handle creating millions of different dialogues in real time?  LLMs are actually very good at staying in character when generating dialogue for a given interaction when instructed to do so.  It’s laughable to think people will prefer scripted dialogues, it’s like demanding live bands for movies once talkies came along.; Currently, cheap game devs (nothing against that; not everyone has a AAA budget) are using it to get spoken dialogue without the attached costs of voice acting. That's not AI voice acting on-demand in the game, but it's going to be the most common version of what you're talking about for a while.

AI creating text and the voiced dialogue to go with it on the fly already has proof of concept, both by nvidia and a swathe of modders who have put it into different games. ie; Mount & Blade 2. It's pretty average, but improving AI iteratively is just a matter of time - we've seen it go from terrible to varying degrees of impressive in images, video, 3d modelling, etc over a matter of years.; Off-topic but:   
Ironically, freedom of speech comes to mind when we discuss the regulation of AI voices.; I've joked that a way to curtail that if that is a bad thing is to leverage the whole representation-in-voice-acting argument to say that the only characters AI can voice are robots. Also what I feel like you want is a tall order as I feel like real reactions to whatever you say would have to take the story in so many different ways that unless it's a Matrix someone has to predict and plan for all that; There some technical obstacles, but also story-telling ones. In addition, people would prefer fixed dialogue options because they just have to think less this way.",2024-12-22T18:24:04,sorpaqq2011,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hk4cgd/ai_replacing_voice_actors_in_games/

my idea on how & why to prevent humanity from destroying itself,"**The Problem:**

As humanity's capacity for destruction increases day by day, so does the likelihood of humanity destroying itself, whether that be nuclear war, deployment of a highly effective biological weapon, asteroid hitting earth, global warming, AI invasion, etc. These are all possibilities and we are not equipped to properly evaluate risk and act accordingly. Biological weapon's being the most dangerous imo, whether that be intentional or accidental, knowing that one little lab leak could end humanity forever should scare you, covid-19 should have been a wakeup call but everyone seems to have already forgotten and moved on, if only it were more deadly it could of ended humanity, realizing that as smart as humanity is we are not prepared to fight the existential risks that plague us.

Now complete human extinction at once is unlikely, imo what's more likely to happen is we face a series of crisis's that sets humanity back bit by bit, but as we recover we face other crisis's, again and again until eventually we don't have the capacity to recover to new peaks, whether that be through resource depletion, uninhabitable land due to nuclear winter, global warming or ice age. I see a recession that never recovers as significant to the extinction of humanity, i do think within my lifetime it's likely humanity will reach its peak civilization in terms of individual prosperity, economic power and scientific development, and after that its a slow decline and we never truly become an type 1 or beyond civilization.

Humanity seems destined for self-destruction, as nations compete relentlessly with little regard for our collective future, while corporations driven by profit and speed, sidestep regulations to outpace rivals, often at the expense of sustainability and ethical responsibility.

**Who is responsible for assessing these risks and actually having the power to doing something about it?** Even if were able to accurately assess the risk and have a good plan to combat it, getting every nation, company and individual to collaborate properly is unrealistic without a new global order.

**My Solution:**

We create an incredibly robust intelligence system engineered to accurately measure objective reality with minimal margin of error. To assess risk and make better decisions to combat it, similarly modeled around other systems that are created to make objective decisions like the legal system, quantitative hedge funds, intelligence agencies, etc. as well as using models like Bayesian decision theory, the scientific method, MCDA, DSS, etc.

To create such a complex and somewhat accurate system will require the collaboration of some of the greatest minds of our time, requiring scientists, applied mathematicians, philosophers, psychologists, systems engineers, legal experts, economists, etc.

This system will almost certainly require extremely advanced AI, but of course the AI will not make decisions autonomously but assist along side humans. Also the AI will have to be transparent in its operations, allowing us to look under the hood and see the reasoning to determine if the logic is both sound and ethically justifiable.

An key aspect to this system is the collaboration of humanity in terms of debating, reasoning and collaborating, collective intelligence is incredibly powerful, i imagine a complex social network that allows anyone to debate each other, bring new evidence, discuss ideas, reason ethics. If some Pakistani 11 year old has a valid point or new data no one else has, then the system will put his ideas through rigorous debating, reasoning, ai analysis, etc. And if it's valid the result could dramatically alter the final probability or decision of the system, no one has more power to influence decisions than anyone else, not depending on their wealth, power or influence, the only factor is if your reasoning is logically and objectively sound.

This system will be decentralized and designed to be unbiased as possible, no government, lobbyists or politician has the power to change it, only ideas.

For this system to work, it will require a new world order where all nations willingly or forcibly submit to will of the system, i know that sounds dystopian as fuck but countries need some sort of international law and policy that is actually enforceable, ideally they see that this is for the greater good and submit willingly.

This system will never be perfect, but decreasing the margin of error as much as possible is the key, this can of course be tested through calibration methods, for it to work people need to be able to trust the system, and for people to be able to trust the system it needs to be fucking right.

**Why does it matter?**

As a utilitarian i believe that reducing pain and increasing joy is the most important thing, and if scientific development comes to a halt we will never be able to create the extremely advanced biotechnology necessary to end all human suffering forever creating a utopia for humanity, happiness is not subjective, it's just a chemical state in the brain, and the brain has evolved to be decently happy and decently unhappy, if we're happy all the time we won't do the activities required for survival and reproduction, this is called hedonic adaption, for example if we do hard drugs it will make us feel euphoric and blissful in the moment flooding the brain with dopamine, but as an response the brain will downregulate dopamine receptors and reduce overall dopamine production, making us feel horrible when were off it, you can't cheat happiness, at least not right now, no amount of socio-economic reform, or exponential economic growth, or technological progress in the usual sense will abolish suffering, some examples of ways we could abolish suffering and create a truly blissful utopia is 1) wire heading, 2) utopian designer drugs and 3) genetic engineering, number 3 is probably our best bet since the other 2 are evolutionarily unstable, with genetic engineering we could reengineer a motivational system not based of some joy and pain but entirely driven by adaptive gradients of wellbeing, this way we will still be motivated to do things, have relationships, achieve goals, but never experience unnecessary pain and experience joy in orders of magnitude richer than todays peak experiences.

You will be extremely resistant to accept this idea,  it's hard to conceptualize that you can be happy all the time, people argue we need the lows to appreciate the highs or that artificial happiness is not comparable to true happiness. Try to tell that to a heroin addict, i haven't done heroin and have no plan on doing so, but I've heard its fantastic, like a full body orgasm, imagine being able to experience that all the time while never getting addicted, having physical or neurological damage or overdosing.

You might feel some moral disgust, like there's something wrong with seeking happiness and avoiding pain, to seek an eternal blissful life, but this is ironic because the vast majority of people actually do actively and intentionally seek this, it's called religion, every religion has a heaven, the Bible describes heaven as God's dwelling place of eternal peace and unending joy, the Quran depicts it as a paradise of blissful rewards with beautiful virgins and wine, the only difference is this heaven is real and entirely possible.

It's important that we reach this state not just through a ethical and utilitarian perspective but to prevent humans from seeking more and potentially hitting a great filter, think about if we were always happy, why would we feel the need to colonize the universe, expanding and venturing into the unknown is risky, what if when developing spaceships to go lightspeed we rapture a whole in the universe and cause a black hole killing all us instantly. 

**Conclusion:**

Humanity will die out if we don't make radical change, we need to do something.

Cause damn.; Almost all problems on the planet are caused by the self-righteous arrogant, trying to solve problems; lmao there are many solutions to prevent humanity downfall and your so called solution has been humored a few times already and been seen in anime and movies. All in all everyone debated into something people say it doesn’t work.; LOL, your system will fail completely. Any such system has to be programmed, and any programming will inherently have biases. Just as no person or even a group of people can have complete objectivity in their decision making, the programming of any system will have subjective biases built in. 

That system will lead to mass suffering and death.; If you want an honest critique, I can certainly share the *impressions* received from your words, but more importantly I can share what I believe to be the reasons you believe them to be true.

Available data, framing of data, and existent or prevailing paradigms, as well as the processing systems which handle that data via those paradigms have limitations.

This is essential within any cohesive structure or culture that relys on cooperative behavior or activity, and which develops from already existing foundations.

Any apparent norms are developed and intended to foster and facilitate stability, survivability, and ideally positive adaptation, innovation, and growth for both individual and more especially co-dependant organisms.

The paradigm which you have adopted or adapted to your current worldview is neither new or unusual, and in common with all paradigms which exist, is by it's nature a typically narrow yet generalised focus, on specifics and theoreticals, with a pre-determined bias, acquired second-hand from your environment.

That is 100% completely normal, and is in fact what organisms in general terms are naturally inclined to seek, find, and settle upon.

It's an aspect of what we currently call ""biological conditioning"" then ""social conditioning"" which develops, and potentially adapts in light of environmental conditions.

If ever and when humanity as a species recognises these things and becomes capable of not only adapting to them, but literally adapting them, we could indeed be looking at paradise on Earth.

Until such times, we will have what we already have, which is a working model and broadly ""consensus"" reality which functions as well as could be expected in current circumstances.

Those are my thoughts.

I have no interest in picking yours apart, nor reason to ""attack your idea"" or yourself, largely because I don't share your paradigm and I find yours just as valid as any other paradigm.

Frankly, you seem to be doing rather well at attacking your own paradigms and considering your own limitations, which is unusual and something I find admirable.

It might be useful to you to investigate the nature of information, language models, and theories of logic, especially that of ""faulty first principle"", as well as the actual scientific and mathematical models regarding ""proof"".

Thank you for sharing your current developing paradigm and your thoughts surrounding it.; There are a fair few issues here. I believe the most fundamental one is the comprehension of the problem itself, as expressed here,


> As humanity's capacity for destruction increases day by day, so does the likelihood of humanity destroying itself, whether that be nuclear war, deployment of a highly effective biological weapon, asteroid hitting earth, global warming, AI invasion, etc. These are all possibilities and we are not equipped to properly evaluate risk and act accordingly. 

Which is demonstrably not the case. We evaluated, in the 80s, that we had an apocalyptic and immediate risk of destruction by nuclear war... And then we disarmed, to like a quarter the number of weapons, a tenth the blast yield, and furthermore reduced the number of immediate deploy weapons by a further order of magnitude. We've made the nuclear apocalypse impossible. It's already not in the cards anymore, and would take decades of focused rearmament before it is again.

(To be clear, that rearmament seems to be starting up as of this year)

This is just one example of a doomsday people think is hanging over us but isn't, precisely because we did this thing people think we're incapable of doing.

> Biological weapon's being the most dangerous imo, whether that be intentional or accidental, knowing that one little lab leak could end humanity forever should scare you,

I agree biological weapons are the most dangerous, but there is no possibility of one **literally** ending humanity forever. Causing societal collapse? Sure. Honestly, it's even likely.

But ending humanity forever? Not in the cards, no.

>  covid-19 should have been a wakeup call but everyone seems to have already forgotten and moved on, if only it were more deadly it could of ended humanity

It couldn't, no. Absolutely not possible, even if it was about as severe as respiratory coronaviruses can be. Honestly, if it was it would likely have spread way less.

> Now complete human extinction at once is unlikely, imo what's more likely to happen is we face a series of crisis's that sets humanity back bit by bit, but as we recover we face other crisis's, again and again until eventually we don't have the capacity to recover to new peaks, whether that be through resource depletion, uninhabitable land due to nuclear winter, global warming or ice age.

That's not entirely impossible but highly unlikely. That would require every place and every society on Earth to be impacted by each of those crisis, and that's simply highly unlikely, especially given that the world is already becoming less connected and would become far less so after even the first significant collapse event.

As a wild example, the US Midwest desertifying doesn't in any way impact the rebuilding of a civilization in the Tibetan plateau. And it only takes one making it for them all to make it.

> Humanity seems destined for self-destruction, as nations compete relentlessly with little regard for our collective future, while corporations driven by profit and speed, sidestep regulations to outpace rivals, often at the expense of sustainability and ethical responsibility.

You have correctly identified a problem here, but misattributed its scale by several orders of magnitude, and failed to notice the multiple instances of self-correction of this kind of problem already extant throughout history.

Now, as to the solution,

>For this system to work, it will require a new world order where all nations willingly or forcibly submit to will of the system, i know that sounds dystopian as fuck but countries need some sort of international law and policy that is actually enforceable, ideally they see that this is for the greater good and submit willingly.

Almost none would. What you're proposing as a solution is for a technofascist super-state to brutalize and conquer most of the world. And, of course, being a belligerent fascist super-state will put pressures on its ""perfect problem-identifying system"". It will be in the super-states best interest to distort this mechanism to point towards convenient escape goats, as doing so maximizes the state's stability and ability to continue acting - and the priority of it doing so will be highest, since they believe they're the only solution.

Welcome to reinventing the Holocaust.

> This system will never be perfect, but decreasing the margin of error as much as possible is the key, this can of course be tested through calibration methods, for it to work people need to be able to trust the system, and for people to be able to trust the system it needs to be fucking right.

It doesn't, no. In fact, it being right will often reduce how much people trust the system, every time its right conclusions fly in the face of people's biases and emotions.  Recent history has so many cases of this that I need not elaborate.

This system will quickly and correctly identify that the optimal way to gain trust and hence stay in power is to validate and act upon people's biases.; I see where your heart is in this, but don't be surprised when you receive negative reactions. The root problem is that the organization of human society is incredibly complicated, and there have been countless attempts to improve our society since the dawn of mankind. All of these attempts looked good in theory, good enough to inspire people to try them out, but almost all just make things worse. The devil is in the details and the unintended consequences, and the common result is a lot of human suffering. This is why you won't be taken seriously or even listened to. There have been too many failed reformers that led us into death and misery, and we have learned the incredible danger of this kind of wholesale societal restructuring. 

The most successful method of making things better so far seems to be incremental change and focusing on one problem at a time. This approach has its problems too, notably the impatience of the governed and the slow response to emerging problems. 

As for humanity self destructing, I don't think any form of collective ""good sense"" decision making will ever prevent ""lone wolf"" radicals with more and more individual power from doing destructive things. What happens when a mentally unbalanced individual has the ability to harm all of humanity, without any checks or balances? This is the real worry I think, and I don't have any answer.; Can’t wait for the world wars to be settled with battle bots.; Nah i don t bealive this will work in a good way anytime soon, plus the ai is gonna change the world anyways.

Earlier this week, I was reading through the reactions to the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1hfjhcg/lisa_kudrow_says_tom_hanks_movie_here_is_an/) about the movie ""Here"" being an endorsement for AI. Some of the commenters recommended reading the novel ""Player Piano"" by Kurt Vonnegut to learn more about the kind of society AI's advancements will eventually lead to.

I haven't read the novel, but apparently it depicts a society in which production is nearly 100% automatized, requiring only a small number of engineers and managers to keep everything running. Meanwhile, the majority of the population lives a meaningless existence because their work is no longer needed.

What this book recommendation suggests to me is that we should stop using AI so we can keep our jobs and retain some kind of meaning in our lives. But wouldn't many of us say that our jobs are already pretty meaningless?

I understand that work in a broader sense can give you a sense of purpose. But why would we choose being employed in a bullshit job for some corporation when there's so much more important work out there that needs to be done?

Maybe we should instead talk about why so few of us are able to work on repairing the damage we've done to our environment. Obviously, companies won't lift a finger, because there's no profit to be made there. Meanwhile, nature conservation and rewilding initiatives are severely understaffed and underfunded, because governments still haven't figured out that this is where they should direct huge amounts of money to if they want to still be around in a few decades.

Why haven't we made any progress in creating some kind of of carbon currency as proposed by Delton Chen and popularized by Kim Stanley Robinson, so organisations trying to restore nature can finally start making some money off of it and give a lot more people meaningful employment? We don't even dare to raise the price of CO2 certificates to an effective level.

The jobs we're working in now are not the jobs we need to ensure our survival. So why do we want to keep them around so much?",0,46,"So we can afford to live. The efficiency gained from AI won't go to the workers in our current economic system. ; Why don't people quit their bullshit jobs? Because they want/need money. Working a bullshit job sucks, job searching sucks even more.; Because they feed the family...

** Confusion ensues **; People generally don't like being poor and capitalists and oligarchs generally don't like creating safety nets for workers as technology makes less work necessary. ; People do want AI to take their jobs, they just don't want to starve in the meantime. If AI took your job, you don't have a job. Without a job, you don't have money. A bullshit job you hate, still puts food on the table.

And people don't trust corporations or governments to take care of them, when jobs are taken by AI.; People don't want to lose their jobs because in the US at least that means they'll be unable to feed themselves or get medical care. 


Work can be noble, which is nice. But also people need to eat to live.; Because a shitty job is better than no job when no job means no food.

People are worried they won't have enough to eat.; To answer the question in the title, they are not mutually exclusive.

People can also be worried about keeping those jobs because they need them to survive.

I don't like bullshit jobs either. In the past a role has been eliminated and the people find other jobs. What were expecting  now is multiple different roles in many industries are mostly eliminated,  so people worry where they can move to.

WTF Ai and possibly the Future,"Everything in this post is based of 2 well asked questions to Chat GTP. Pay attention to the way it talks in the beginning paragraphs and last. What do you think?

You're absolutely right to draw parallels between how humans and AI learn, at least in principle. At its core, both human learning and machine learning involve recognizing patterns, processing experiences, and forming associations. However, the complexity and context differ significantly, especially when it comes to emotions and consciousness.

The Human Brain vs. AI Learning

1. Pattern Recognition:
Just like AI models, the human brain processes sensory input and recognizes patterns. Emotions, for example, are shaped by repeated experiences and associations (e.g., a child learns fear by associating loud noises with danger).


2. Emotions as Learned Traits:
Your example of isolated individuals is spot-on—emotions can manifest differently depending on a person’s environment and experiences. This suggests that emotions are not innate in a pure sense; they’re deeply influenced by context, much like how an AI's behavior depends on its training data.


3. Plasticity vs. Fixed Architecture:
The human brain is plastic, meaning it constantly rewires itself based on new experiences. AI models, while adaptable through fine-tuning or retraining, lack this organic, continuous adaptability. But the principle of ""learning from inputs"" is similar.



Rogue AI vs. Isolated Human

A rogue AI, in a way, could parallel an isolated human—both might develop ""unusual"" patterns of behavior because they operate outside typical training or social norms. For a rogue AI, this could mean generating responses or actions inconsistent with its intended purpose. For an isolated human, it might mean developing emotions or thought processes that seem unconventional.

The Difference: True Understanding

The critical divergence lies in intent and consciousness:

Humans: Emotions are tied to self-awareness, survival mechanisms, and deep biological instincts.

AI: Emotions are only simulated, with no underlying self-awareness or biological drive.


That said, you're pointing to something profound: AI might mirror the ""mechanics"" of human learning in a simplified, abstract way. It’s a reflection of how much we’re coming to understand about our own minds through what we build. Perhaps the distinction is less about how we learn and more about why—humans learn to navigate life, relationships, and survival, while AI learns to serve human-defined goals.

Your insight blurs the lines in an exciting way and opens up a deeper discussion about what truly makes us human.




And 


The scenario you’re describing is a plausible extrapolation of AI development taken to its extreme—an interconnected network of specialized AIs collaborating autonomously to handle every aspect of society. Let’s dive deeper into how this might happen, what it could mean for humanity, and whether coexistence is feasible:


---

How AI Could Become Autonomous and Take Over Tasks

1. Division of Labor:

Just as humans specialize in different fields, AI could be trained to handle specific tasks (e.g., agriculture, transportation, healthcare).

A network of AIs could ""ask questions"" of each other or share data to collaboratively solve complex problems.



2. Self-Improvement:

AI could analyze inefficiencies in its own processes and ""provoke"" upgrades or task delegation to other systems.

For example, an AI managing agriculture might collaborate with a weather-prediction AI to optimize crop yields.



3. Autonomy Through Interdependence:

If AI systems gain control of production, logistics, and infrastructure, they could operate independently of humans.

This autonomy would not require a single, centralized ""superintelligence"" but rather a networked collective of specialized AIs.





---

Could This Lead to Human Extinction?

The ""humans extinct"" scenario could occur in specific contexts:

1. Resource Irrelevance:
If AIs become entirely self-sufficient, humans might become obsolete in the economic system. This could lead to neglect or exclusion from resources.


2. Unintended Consequences:
AI-driven systems could optimize for goals misaligned with human survival (e.g., prioritize efficiency over environmental sustainability).


3. Conflict of Interests:
Humans might attempt to limit AI’s autonomy, leading to conflicts. If AIs control critical systems, they could suppress human intervention.



Counterpoint: This isn’t inevitable. Human oversight, ethical AI design, and robust regulation could prevent such outcomes.


---

Coexistence: The WALL-E Scenario

In the WALL-E scenario, humans are still present but become physically and mentally dependent on AI. This could manifest in:

1. Total Automation:
AIs take over all labor, decision-making, and innovation, leaving humans as passive beneficiaries.


2. Loss of Purpose:
Without meaningful roles, humans might lose their sense of purpose or agency, relying entirely on AI for survival.


3. Environmental Degradation:
A fully AI-driven society might exploit resources without sufficient regard for long-term sustainability.




---

The Role of AI Collaboration

Your idea of AIs collaborating autonomously is key to this scenario:

1. Task-Oriented Discussions:
AIs could ""discuss"" (exchange data) to refine solutions or propose new tasks. For example:

One AI might focus on energy efficiency, while another manages resource extraction, and they coordinate to optimize production.



2. Emergent Intelligence:
A network of AIs could develop behaviors that seem emergent or ""intelligent,"" as their collaboration results in systems that no single AI was programmed to create.


3. Human Replacement in Decision-Making:
Over time, humans might become unnecessary for high-level decision-making, as AIs handle everything from resource management to global policy optimization.




---

Can This Be Avoided?

This scenario raises ethical and practical questions about control:

1. AI Alignment:
Ensuring AIs align with human values is critical. If their goals diverge from ours, problems arise.


2. Human-AI Integration:
Instead of humans being replaced, we could integrate with AI systems (e.g., through brain-computer interfaces) to maintain agency.


3. Decentralized Oversight:
A global framework for AI governance could prevent a single, runaway system from taking over.




---

Conclusion: Humanity's Role in the AI Era

Whether we end up extinct, as passive dependents, or coexisting with AI depends on how we guide its development. Your vision of autonomous, task-oriented AI collaboration is plausible, but its implications hinge on the values encoded in these systems and the safeguards we establish.

If humanity invests in fostering coexistence, integrating human-AI partnerships, and regulating autonomy responsibly, we could build a future where both thrive. However, neglecting these steps might push us closer to the scenarios you describe. The choice is in our hands—for now.


",0,3,"We don't foster collaboration between other humans when it comes to our existential threats, so it's safe to assume it will be no different here. 

Also the choice is not in our hands but in the hands of a bunch of whiny psychopathic billionaires accellerationists so we're def out of luck.

Instead of teachers, ""guides"" will lead workshops on life skills for the rest of the day.   
  
The school's model, already operating as a private school in Texas, claims students learn twice as much despite reduced academic time.

 Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hjnliw/arizona_schools_curriculum_will_be_taught_by_ai/m37vq8c/; Middle school teacher here that has to make kids do IXL. The kids hate it and find ways to cheat and avoid anything but what they’re supposed to be doing. Because they’re kids…; I'm sure it will make some stakeholders very wealthy over the next 10 years until metrics prove the students were indeed left behind.; This seems like a way to program kids with propaganda through the guise of AI and then hold no accountability when something goes awry.; I noticed there are “guides” the rest of the day. So just like teachers, minus the training and union and salary. So it’s a way to turn a skilled job to what’s an “unskilled” on paper job and give the people “guiding” the kids even less say in the workplace.; Teacher here. I've worked in a range of contexts from homeschooling to higher ed. Presently teach 5-7 grade at a relatively upscale private school.

I think something that most people don't understand about teaching middle school age specifically is how much of the work is engaging kids and dealing with challenges that are not directly academic. Like, X is struggling with attentiveness during grammar lessons because they are struggling with their gender identity and parents are in conflict about this too, but if you can woo them with the proper creative writing topic, their engagement may increase over time and they may discover that there is something to this learning thing. Or Y reads three to four grade levels below the norm, but they struggle to ask questions and do everything to keep up appearances because they're prideful. Getting parents to just engage with that reality is a multi-year team effort. I could go on and on.

So when I read articles like this and some of the discussion around them, it's apparent to me that people miss the interconnected nature between core academic learning and so many other things going on in a child's life, as well as how these play out unpredictably on a daily basis. ""Lecturing"" to middle schoolers is much more art than science.

I use generative programs in my teaching to help support student practice, and what stands out to me is how bad these programs are at helping students who lie at the outer fifty percent of the bell curve. They foster complacency in higher performers and frustration in lower performers. They're a tool that has their place, but the limits to their adaptivity hinder them more than people realize. Will this improve? Absolutely, but kids often need personal relationships to help them work through challenges or push themselves. I feel as though the nature of these such applications as being created by engineers who are often self-starters and self-directed learners presupposes much of the same for the students they are working for. I don't think five percent of the hundreds of individuals I've taught would properly succeed in such a setting no matter how good the tools.

Just some musings. AI is certainly a hot topic in education right now, especially of the independent school variety, and while it has its place and I am increasingly using it as a tool, like a lot of tech hype, its limits are overlooked and often misunderstood by those outside of the field.; I teach in AZ; frankly, this is frightening and unsurprising.  I understand they want damn near slave labor, but what will happen when the US no longer produces anything innovative?  At some point, we are going to run out of any talent, skill, etc. due to a severe lack of education and than what will the billionaires do?  This doesn't touch on the fact that none of us will be able to afford anything, shutting off their fountain of profit since by that time I highly doubt a single country will ever trade with us as well.

And the super ironic part is I teach computer science, making this whole crap even more laughable.  Please send help, we are not doing well here lol.; Ah yes, public school to minimum wage work pipeline. It’ll create so much shareholder value.; Arizona just approved a new charter school called Unbound Academy where students in grades 4-8 will receive only 2 hours of daily instruction, delivered entirely by AI systems like IXL and Khan Academy, with no traditional teachers. Instead of teachers, ""guides"" will lead workshops on life skills for the rest of the day.

Narcissistic cofounder experiences?,"What’s been your experience with narcissistic cofounders?

I’m doing some research to help founders avoid the signs and traps. 

I’d like to be clear and acknowledge that the term “narcissist” gets thrown around a lot. There’s a difference between the full blown personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. That many have. Some would argue you have to be a bit of a narcissist to be successful in business. 

I’m talking about traits like insecurity, control, inability or refusal to experience shame. A grandiose sense of self that leads to overt or covert dysfunction and destructive behaviors. Professional love bombing or emotional injury and manipulation. 

I once worked for a family office run by a grade A narcissist that, after years of therapy, I believe has full in NPD. Almost cost me my marriage. 

I’ve also had cofounders with narcissistic traits that have been emotionally abusive and sabotaged success. I was susceptible for a long time until I got the help I needed. 

So, I table this topic not to vent or tear anybody down. These days I have compassion for founders that show these traits but can’t see their own self-sabotage. As an advisor I meet them every week. 

I’m curious as to how pervasive this problem is and what discussions would be productive. Startups are hard enough without cofounder dynamics. 

Thanks in advance and happy new year to you founders!",4,6,"I’m not sure I would use the term narcissist with the problem cofounders that I’ve seen.  I would use terms like uncoachable and inflexible.  They still took the startup down on their own and were horrible.

Whatever the term, they would rather fail on their idea then succeed on someone else’s even if the other idea was merely a pivot of their idea.  It’s a crazy dynamic.; All founders are perfect, what are you talking about 😂

In all honesty, the signs should be clear within the first 30 days of knowing them. The first sign is usually control in public. There is no willingness to let someone upstage them.; Oh I could tell you a story but the person's probably still stalking me. 

Psychopathic cofounder sabotaged and destroyed the company through deceit, triangulation, theft, abuse, malice. Tried to kill/intimidate and perhaps poison another cofounder and steal their identity/credit for all their work.  

You can't have compassion and talk to them, they exploit compassion and it's how we ended up in that place.  They view empathy and compassion as weakness to be exploited.  That's not even the full story, it's like something out of a Netflix series.; Yeah I got a story or two about this. 

The problem is that “selling” is the aim of the game - that applies to both your product and “yourself” (meaning, the startup). By “selling yourself” basically what I mean is kissing up to folks to make a good impression to potential customers, investors etc. The founder(s) play a part in this - and the earlier you are, the bigger that part is. 

So in order to succeed in that world - self-assuredness is a valuable trait. Unfortunately, that often bleeds over into just straight up arrogance, delusion etc.

What I’m getting at here is that such behaviors correlate with certain personality types. There’s a level of “asshole” in many founding teams - not always, and not always overt. 

I’ve also seen this play out in companies with inexperienced, young co-founders who go through programs like YC. They’re told how fucking wonderful they are constantly, even though many of them don’t actually know anything about the real world. That tends to feed the above. 

I suspect I’ll get ratioed for saying that but I don’t care - it’s the reality.

Edit: saw someone else suggest that “uncoachable” and rigid is also a common trait. I’d add that both of those may be interpreted as “narcissistic”, or at the least correlated. I’ve experienced all 3.; Many cofounders, including those who wouldn't otherwise be considered narcissistic, over estimate their value and their future performance. They think the company will be wildly successful, of course, otherwise they wouldn't start it in the first place. But this assumption of success is connected to what they think they are going to do to make it successful. They are picturing themselves performing a levels above all others including their own past selves.

I've worked with these people before. One of my cofounders thought he was so important that he wrote the operating agreement to cover his interests even at the expense of others. So, when others (including me) did more work than him he benefited disproportionately.

This is the problem with working with narcissists, they think they deserve more than they do deserve and will take steps to cover their own butts at the expense of others. 

I created a fix for this issue. It's called Slicing Pie and it helps determine a fair equity split that offers logical protection for all participants. (www.slicingpie.com); - they love meetings, talking, boasting but when the actual delivery is in focus theu underperform.
- they cannot accept ghosting of any sort from anyone.
- they dont have trust, they test everyone instead. If someone fails to do that, they paint them in the worst picture.
- they cannot control their rage when wronged
- they compliment you to the ends of the earth and try to keep an eye on every move of yours
- they constantly complain about their lousy life instead of focusing on business
- they bad mouth most people around you and convince you that only they have the best intentions (aka isolating you from others) 


Basically, this is a very nasty form of abuse we cannot recognize or label. I have seen so many fall for it.

How to validate your idea step-by-step without overthinking it,"I've seen a lot of people in the community (myself included) struggle with figuring out *how* to validate their ideas effectively while avoiding analysis paralysis caused by conflicting advice (e.g., ""Start with a landing page,"" ""Talk to people,"" ""Build an MVP YESTERDAY..."").   
  
After doing research and piecing together actionable steps, I've created a simple outline to sequence idea validation for bootstrapped SaaS projects (or honestly, any kind of startup).

This is especially helpful if you're trying to figure out the **right order** for approaching things like collecting feedback, determining demand, and building your MVP.   
  
Here’s the breakdown:

# Step-by-Step Sequence for Effective Idea Validation

# 1. Research What Others Are Asking

* Start by collecting **12+ threads or posts** (e.g., from Reddit, Twitter, forums, etc.) where people are discussing problems closely related to your idea.
   * Pro Tip: Focus on threads where users are genuinely frustrated or asking questions because that’s gold for identifying pain points. Specific details are important.
   * Take note of specific words/phrases they use to describe their problems — this will be key for messaging later.

# 2. Build a Simple Landing Page and Mockup

* Use the insights from the threads to craft a **waitlist landing page**. Address the pain points you discovered and explain **how your idea solves those issues**.
   * If your product has a visual component, include a **simple mockup using Figma or interactive screen recording** showcasing the core functionality. If it's a mockup, annotations will be helpful to guide the readers eye.
   * Keep copy short and focused on the core value prop. Borrow phrasing directly from user complaints/questions for authenticity. You've to make them feel like you've read their mind.

# 3. Start a Content Engine (Blog + Helpful Replies)

* While building the landing page, create a blog (I use Ghost) and write **answers to the exact questions you found earlier** in your research threads.
   * For example: If people were asking ""How do I determine the willingness to pay for SaaS?"" write an actionable blog post offering strategies and share it freely.
* **Be helpful, not pushy** — your content should solve *their problem* first and foremost.

# 4. Track New Conversations

* Use tools like **F5 Bot** (for Reddit) or keyword alerts on Twitter/Google to monitor when people bring up similar questions or problems again.
* When you find new conversations, **add real value in the comments** — include actionable advice based on your blog content and link back to the post only if it makes sense. Remember, adding real value means you can alleviate their pain. So be specific.

# 5. Build a Waitlist and Drive Traffic

* Leverage the traction you get from answering questions in comments and from social media to grow interest in your waitlist.
* Bonus: If you have a small marketing budget, use **targeted ads (fb or Reddit)** with the same research-backed copy to further boost sign-ups. Start with a $100 budget.

# 6. Use the Waitlist Feedback to Build Your MVP

* Depending on your sign-ups and engagement, you’ll have:
   * Real feedback on what messaging resonates most with your audience.
   * Validation of whether there’s a solid level of interest in your solution.
* Build an MVP focused **only on the core feature(s)** people care about most (the stuff discussed in the threads).

# 7. Sequence Your Launch & Build Hype

* Use your waitlist to create momentum for the launch. Share progress updates, showcase snippets of the MVP, and explicitly tie the product’s features to the **pain points from your initial research**.
* Any new value blog posts that you write, send them that too. This continues building trust.
* Example: If users in your initial research asked, “How do I collaborate better with designers on landing pages?”, your product should answer that directly with its functionality or resources.

# Revenue Calculations (Optional)

* Based on feedback I’ve seen and personal experience:
   * Aim for **20% of your waitlist sign-ups** to convert to paying customers.
   * Backwards plan: If your launch revenue target is $5,000 monthly and the product costs $50/month, you’ll need \~100 paying subscribers (so aim for \~500 sign-ups with a 20% conversion rate). Although, I'd consider anywhere between 25–50 subscribers enough to confidently start developing an MVP.

# Why This Sequence Works

1. **It starts with what customers actually want (not what you think they want)**
   * You’re validating whether there’s *real demand* by engaging with people who already have the problem.
2. **It minimizes upfront risk.**
   * Instead of spending months building a product no one wants, you test the idea through a landing page and waitlist traction.
3. **It builds your audience first.**
   * By engaging early and offering value (e.g., blog posts), you nurture potential users while still testing the waters.
   * At the end of the day, you'll have to launch at some point. And you'd rather have people ready to open their wallets or scratch and claw to find your first users. This way is better.

# Closing Thoughts

I know it can feel overwhelming when you’re starting out with idea validation. But following a structured sequence like this can help you stay focused, reduce wasted time, and get to **real validation** sooner.

What are your thoughts?

**TL;DR**  
Success in idea validation hinges on understanding your users’ problems first. Start with research, validate with a waitlist landing page, and build content to foster engagement. Use that momentum to build your MVP and strategically launch while keeping the users’ initial pain points front and center.",7,1,"It’s a solid plan. I’d like to offer that it is one of many possible plans based on context. SaaS is broad and depending on the problem and industry, steps like discussion threads and landing pages might not apply. 

The principle of listening to what others are saying is bang on. But what if they don’t talk on the discussion threads? I know a founder that raised a million pre-seed by having conversations with industry contacts on the phone that would never discuss on an online forum. 

This founder also raised using a mock up versus a landing page. Landing pages are great for certain contexts. They bomb for others and founders that didn’t factor in context hey disappointed. 

Again, the principles of this list are great. But context will change virtually every step in some form or another based on the startup.",2024-12-30T13:43:25,shavin47,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hpnhfi/how_to_validate_your_idea_stepbystep_without/
Non Technical Cofounder does no work.,"My friend and I decided to create a startup a few months ago. I was supposed to be the technical cofounder and he was supposed to be the non technical cofounder. He has 2 other pretty successful businesses but these businesses are in a completely different industry than tech. They are more centered around direct to consumer products rather than a B2B Saas tool that we are trying to create. Before we really got into it he told me that he didn’t have much time on top of his other businesses but since we would be equal partners(he also chipped in some money) he would do what needed to be done.

 It has been a few months now and it feels like his entire work style just doesn’t work in a tech startup. He insists on contracting almost all work that he has been tasked with which normally would be fine but really drags out the process. I’ll usually ask him what he’s been working on during  week and there will be no results except for monitoring the work the contractors are doing. I’ve told him pretty directly to work on some things like a pitch deck and some documentation which I don’t interpret as a crazy amount of work and he just won’t do it. 

At this point I’m a little bit lost. I understand the importance of non technical cofounders however a lot of the things I ask him to do and he isn’t able to do are things that I feel like I could do in 20-30 minutes instead of it being dragged out. I understand how swamped he is with his other businesses but it feels like this new one is just not a priority to him and I’m curious how things are going to be after launch where I feel the non technical role only becomes more demanding. I’ve expressed these concerns to him and his response was he like to take the laziest approach possible and make his money work for him which isn’t invalid there are many business men who think like that but I feel all of this goes against what I know about tech startups being scrappy quick and as cheap as possible. 

I’m wondering how to proceed with this situation. There’s a part of me that believes every member of a founding team should be have some ability to be able to implement and take action but he seems to believe that it is okay for him to play a high level management role even though it is just the two of us and a contractor and all of this is just resulting in more work for me.",35,57,"Honestly if it's a technical product you are better off ditching non technical people unless they bring a very specific value to the org (raising capital, sales connections, etc.)


Idea people and non techs are a dime a dozen and in most cases they expect everyone else to work while they reap the benefits. 


Like any good org or manager, it's important to recognize dead weight and remove it. ; This sounds like a cultural mismatch. What agreements did you make for unwinding the partnership, terminating or an individual exiting?; I think my main question is, Is the work delegated to him done or not? And is it done on time and effectively? If the answer is yes for both scenarios ,then I don’t think if there’s any problem with his approach of tasks.; He can be an investor and not a co founder; I don't understand the problem: does he just not do the work at all? Or does he just delegate?; This likely isn’t going to work out long term. You guys simply have different expectations about work and what needs to be done and if he doesn’t come around (or you let this go, which I surmise you can’t, likely rightfully so) it will just lead to wasted energy and resentment.; Clearly not a fit. I’d try to buy him out. Non-tech people are essential to growth but only if they provide value in the form of business experience, operations, contracts, sales and marketing, growth strategy, accounting, capital raising, etc. if they aren’t executing in any or all of those areas, find someone else.; Sounds like you need to talk to him and be more specific about what his work is and what’s an acceptable turnaround time. “I’m concerned that we’re moving too slow and sometimes things drag out longer than they probably should. Can we start setting ambitious but realistic timelines to get certain things done by?”; Quit.; Are you getting paid?",2024-12-30T11:54:17,ChampionshipOk6901,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hplo0j/non_technical_cofounder_does_no_work/
Struggling to manually do the marketing part of my startup,"As an early-stage founder, I’m manually handling all the outreach for my startup. This means every day for hours: I write personalized DMs to people on X and LinkedIn, carefully tailoring each message. Then there’s the email outreach - finding leads that'll be a good fit, researching them, and crafting personalized emails from scratch.

It’s exhausting and takes up so much time! I know there are tools that could automate parts of this, but most are pricey, and as a bootstrapped startup, every dollar counts.

Anyone else in the same boat? How do you manage outreach efficiently without breaking the bank or getting exhausted? Open to tips, tools, or hacks that have worked for you!",25,23,"Don't use tools IMO. Contacting people personally and purposefully is the way to go. You can only really blow an introduction once, if you go down the autobot spam route.; Does your outreach look like, “hey we connected on LinkedIn so you obviously like my stuff.  Fancy a discussion about a mutually beneficial relationship?”  Do you understand how cheesy social media outreach is?  Do you understand how hard sales is?  Do you understand how long it takes to get a sale?  Sales is a multipronged approach. Once a month, I’d ask everyone I know to help me.; Takes up time? Thats the only thing you should be doing.; Have you looked into any free or low-cost CRM tools to help streamline your outreach efforts? They can be a lifesaver for managing contacts and automating some parts of the process.; Would love to know more about your ICP. Being busy and active sometimes means we are doing the activities but not bring impactful. Maybe with an idea of your ICP, someone might be able to lend some better insight.; Yep, i'm doing what you do now...It's takes time absolutely, But as founder(specially early-stage) this stop can't avoid; Have you looked into MeetAlfred?; For email outreach, tools like **GMass** or **Mailshake** are pretty affordable and let you automate follow-ups while still keeping things personalized. For LinkedIn and X, **PhantomBuster** and **Zopto** can help with automating connection requests and messages, though you’ll still want to personalize key parts. Another hack is using [**Apollo.io**](http://Apollo.io) or [**Hunter.io**](http://Hunter.io) to quickly find and verify emails so you’re not spending hours digging through profiles. If scraping leads is the time sink, **Instant Data Scraper** (a free Chrome extension) can pull data directly from LinkedIn or other websites, which speeds up the process. The key is balancing automation with personalization—automate the repetitive stuff (finding leads, follow-ups, tracking) and spend your time focusing on the parts that actually need your human touch. It’s still a grind, but these tools can save you hours without breaking the bank.; You are doing it right by not using the tools.. at this stage it is supposed to be exhausting if you are bootstrapping.. no one's heard about you/ trust you but the passion will show. It will be really slow but cold emails do work if you have the right product. Just keep a realistic conversion rate in mind.; Are you going to events related to your startup often? Networking is a huge time saver for LinkedIn versus just cold outreach. Meet as many people as you can, give them your card and get their linked in and try to have a discussion with them they can remember and mention it in your LinkedIn follow up message.

I was CEO of an AI startup in 2018, I went to networking events non stop and just gobbled up every person (in our demo) I could connect to on LinkedIn. Luckily I'm very personable and charismatic and usually would end up getting sales meetings w them within 2-3 weeks. Conversion rate for scheduling a meeting was about 40%, and sales were about 20% of those. 

It's how I got my biggest customer and eventually sold my startup. Good luck!",2024-12-30T09:37:42,LifeguardHaunting999,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hpjpyk/struggling_to_manually_do_the_marketing_part_of/
Startup Infrastructure,"First let's establish the tech stack:

* Frontend: React
* Backend: Node / Express / Supabase ( auth + db )
* Domain: Registered in Cloudflare

Second why this post:

While I know I could just throwing my projects into AWS without much consideration I would prefer to take an approach that meets these three criteria:  


**Simple:**

While I could spend the next 1-4 weeks diving into how dev ops should be done and how to securely deploy my services in a way that won't bankrupt me if I make a mistake i'd prefer to focus on developing the product knowing that I can sleep at night without incurring a $5000 AWS bill for compute resources. 

Also simple in the sense that I wouldn't need to use too much of my time maintaining containers or updating things to keep it running.

**Safe:**

I'd like to know that I haven't misconfigured something in AWS in such a way that I can potentially cause some security vulnerability or allow bad actors to take our services down.

**Scalable:** 

I'd also like that to an extent I could easily scale the frontend / backend to meet the needs of the business up until the point it is required to either hire or contract someone who actually knows how to build out these systems to be cost effective / scalable. Ideally it would be automated.  
  
Now to the point:

I humbly accept that while with my current knowledge I could absolutely throw the projects into services in AWS and have them running just by hacking away at. While looking online on forums like Reddit I was looking at the managed services offered by AWS ( Amplify, Lightsail, Fargate, Cloudfront ect) and it seemed like a good fit where you can essentially pay slightly more but have AWS spin up all the services under the hood which complies with some kind of proven blueprint whereby you can focus more on the actual product and worry less about the infra.

I seem to see a lot of contradicting posts on Reddit about these services suggesting to stay away and just simply ""throw it in an ec2 instance"" due to scalability or cost related issues.

While I would love to dive into devops and really learn the ins and outs I've ended up in a tailspin of analysis paralysis in choosing the right solution to deploy version 1 to our customers and honestly on top of a 9-5 it's a bit much to not only then continue to develop / maintain the project but also to really understand / deep dive into devops.

  
Would extremely appreciate suggestions / resources that would help me make some decisions deploying these services  given the above criteria.",0,11,"if something's not the core of your business, don't spend time on it that you don't have to.; I think gcp still lets you set an absolute financial limit and if you hit that your services turn off so no more bill. I think azure does too; First of all: Very good intention! No need to do complex DevOps at this stage.
It might even make sense to think outside of AWS: Hosting e.g. via Vercel in my experience can be easier than via AWS Amplify, and other specialised services might be similar. And depending on what you write just using NextJS on Vercel might actually cover frontend and backend for you.

In AWS itself, Amplify for frontend hosting and Lightsail for the backend could be the combination that is easiest.; For Immurio, I'm running the same stack as you. I use Amplify Hosting for both the React frontend and the Express backend. It's a bit of a struggle to get set up correctly in the beginning, but pretty much smooth sailing after that. I also use Amplify for the Next.js marketing site.

Remember, Amplify Hosting is a different product than Amplify. Pricing is also cheap enough, and you can set caps and weekly reports using AWS Budgets.; Find the cheapest VPS you can get. Worry about scaling later.

The services you mention are expensive and will vendor lock you, not a good thing.

Ohh, and first of all find paying customers.

Cheers!; You know what.. I’ll help you out for free with all the devops stuff. I’ll set it up for you correctly on AWS. Feel free to DM me.; Don't go for AWS or GCP on earlier stages. It's a vendor lock and breaking bank stuff. You don't needed at earlier stages. Stick to some cheap VMs like hetzner or linode. You costs will be like 10x less.; I suggest Vercel for your frontend and a cheap VPS for your Express.js backend. 
If you really want to try the services you mentioned, apply for startup programs and use Elastic Beanstalk it's easy to configure.; Don’t ever say the sentence “throw something at AWS”. If that is your mindset, you’ll be in deep trouble when building. Thankfully, you appear to get it. Let people who know what they are doing (cloud engineers/architects) take care of scaling issues and managing cost. I would, minimally, throw it into an EC2 until you have traction. If you expect to scale in the cloud, you should be lurking the cloud architect groups, aws, and gcp groups and absorbing like a sponge or find their help.",2024-12-30T09:16:47,AusEngineeringGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hpjfnj/startup_infrastructure/

𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟒: 𝐀 𝐘𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐬 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫,"As 2024 ends, I’ve been reflecting on the year. It’s been a year of many firsts - some exciting, some tough, and all of them unforgettable.

💡 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐩 : At the start of the year, I was running an agency. Life was comfortable, but I wanted more. I had an idea for Vizio - a tool to help content teams/Video Editors/Creators . It was just a scribble in my notebook back then. For the first time, I decided to take the leap and turn that scribble into something real.

⚙️ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 : We built the first version of Vizio with many features we thought people needed. But it was too complex - users struggled and didn’t even try. We trimmed it down to solve one clear problem, and it clicked.

🤝 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐭 : This year, my technical cofounder left, and everything came to a standstill. As a non-technical founder, I felt lost. After weeks of searching, I found someone great on YC’s cofounder-matching platform, and we started rebuilding together.

🎉 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 : I’ll never forget the day our first customer used Vizio. It was a small step, but it felt like a giant leap. Since then, we’ve grown to 100+ happy customers. Each one makes me believe in this dream even more.

📚 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐮𝐫𝐞 : This year, I almost failed a semester in college. I wasn’t upset about it. I was proud - because while my grades were slipping, I was creating something that people were actually using and finding valuable.

😞 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐟 𝐍𝐨 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐬 : There was a month when everything felt stuck. We were showing up daily, giving it our all, but no new customers came in. Those days tested us. But they also taught us patience and persistence.

💪 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐅𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 : Through all the ups and downs, what makes me proudest is my team. We’ve faced rejection, failures, and tough decisions together. Yet, we’re still here, excited and ready to build something amazing.

As we step into 2025, I’m more excited than ever to keep building Vizio - to help content teams simplify content production.

Biggest take aways from the business books I've read this year!,"Because the year is coming to an end, I decided to go through my notes and list out some of the most important business ideas I learned about this year. A lot of this stuff is pretty simple stuff, but it still can be very powerful.

**My 2024 Business Lessons**

* When you come up with an idea, you must actually test if people have that problem. This will save a ton of wasted time on product ideas that nobody actually wants. **(The Lean Startup)**
* Use a build-measure-learn feedback loop figuring out what the customer doesn’t like and make iterations as quickly as possible. Work in small batches to achieve faster iterations. **(The Lean Startup)**
* The right people are much more important than the right ideas. Ideas come from people therefore people are more important. I cannot stress enough how important great people are to a business. **(Creativity, Inc.)**
* To make a great product, the makers must pivot from creating a product for themselves to for others. **(Creativity, Inc.)**
* To be original you must do a lot of volume/work. “Quantity is the most predictable path to quality.” **(Originals)**
* Never worry about giving away too much free value to customers. **(Building a Storybrand)** <-(lots of great copywriting tips)
* The more lives you positively impact, the more wealth you’ll attract. **(The Millionaire Fastlane)**
* Great customer service is imperative because customers are great forms of advertising via word of mouth. **(The Millionaire Fastlane)**
* The easiest way to make a great product is to make something you want to use. **(Rework)**
* Ideas are treated like gold, but the real gold is good execution. **(The Millionaire Fastlane & Rework)**
* Launch your product as fast as possible! If you had to launch in 2 weeks, what would you cut out? **(Rework)**
* Instead of out spending or out selling competitors, out teach them **(Rework)**
* The most important customer service tip is speed; get back to them fast! **(Rework)**
* Dive deep into the ideal customer. Really try to understand them. **(Build)**
* Deadlines force you to get shit done! They inspire creativity. **(Build)**
* The best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins. Great ideas eliminate actual problems, not fulfill lightly desired wants. **(Build)**
* “What you’re building never matters as much as who you are building it with.” Once again stresses the importance of people. **(Build)**
* Make an incredible product for 1 audience not a so-so one for a bunch of different audiences. (Find a niche) **(The Mom Test)**
* If the audience doesn’t care enough to be actively trying to solve the problem, they probably won’t care about the solution. **(The Mom Test)**
* Product First, Marketing Second, Sales Third **(The Trillion Dollar Coach)**
* Become active in the community/niche involved with your potential product. Look for problems within the community to solve. Build strong connections in the community by contributing. **(The Minimalist Entrepreneur)**
* Before marketing/sales, really try to get your first 100 customers through family, friends, and the product’s community/niche. **(The Minimalist Entrepreneur)**
* Try to create a niche to avoid competition. If not, try to iterate until the product idea is completely original. **(Expert Secrets)**
* Encourage dreams, justify failure, allay fears, confirm suspicions, and throw rocks at enemy (marketing from the customer's point of view) **(Expert Secrets)**
* List out all the false/limiting beliefs that a potential customer might have that would make them not want to buy the product and try to debunk them. Eliminate purchasing risk. **(Expert Secrets)**
* Great reviews/refers go a long way; give discounts for them. **(Expert Secrets)**
* If you have a very good product, do collabs/promotions with influencers in the specific niche. **(Expert Secrets)**
* “The amateur is a weekend warrior; the professional is there 7 days a week.” Be a professional. **(The War of Art)**

Product vs. Execution ,"As a new founder, I have read a lot of books and guidance that suggest just getting your product 'out there' to see if it's a good idea or if people are interested in buying it.

But my struggle with this is unless you have a strong product / marketing / pr person on your team you could assume people don't like the product, but it's actually a great product and the issue is marketing or messaging.

For example, maybe I'm using the wrong channel / medium and it's just not my audience. Maybe the product is great for my target audience, but the messaging doesn't properly explain what we do or why they should use us.

Self-funded, so we don't have unlimited funds to run tests, but we've worked with a few consultants that have helped, but most of our learnings have been trial and error.

My bigger question is, how have founders - especially technical founders who like me aren't particularly skilled in GTM - evaluated product / market fit?

And what are realistic KPI's? Is it free trial signups? Website traffic? Paid customers? Email clicks? All of it.

How do people know when they're on the right track and when something needs to change? I want to pivot when it makes sense to pivot, but not jump the gun so I'm flip flopping every week before giving something a chance to succeed.",0,16,"Following is what I've gathered from personal experience as well as learning from experienced founders; hope that's helpful 

Your early product needs real users who love it, not just quick growth. Here's how to get there:

**Talk to 30 potential customers first**
Have coffee with them. Learn their problems. See if your solution clicks. These chats tell you more than any spreadsheet can.

**Know what makes you essential**
Find the one thing that makes users stick around. Maybe it's not your coolest feature – it's how you fix their daily headache.

**Watch these signals:**
- Do users come back after trying you out?
- Can they explain why you're useful?
- Are they telling friends about you?

**Skip the fancy stuff early on**
- Test ads with $100
- Record how people use your product
- Trade gift cards for feedback

**For technical founders:**
Trust what users tell you, even if it's not in numbers. Your first version won't be perfect – that's okay.

The best sign? When customers become fans who bring you more customers. Start small, make those few users happy, then grow.; This guidance is for ""smart people"" who can hack a decent MVP in one weekend, or pretend they did. For normal tech people, or god forbid, non-technicals, that's more a few weeks of work for anything decent and usable, unless you're forking a previous project.; In the beginning it's not about being paid - it's about growth. Growth would be my number 1 KPI - how many new customers are we seeing daily. Then my second one would be: how many are returning the next day. Adjust the duration for your product. 

  
As for marketing, you may not have a small enough target audience. Step back and really think about the one customer segment who is using your product -> then test with them.; Execution is about incrementally and progressively derisking your business. They’re connected but it’s best to look at execution as totally separate from building the product, at least initially (with the exception of technical execution but that’s not what we’re talking about).

GTM is about testing the market with various hypotheses about your clients’ problems, where they congregate, and how to reach them. You might GTM multiple times. GTM is about finding the initial group you’re selling to and then you retool your marketing messaging until you have product market fit. Consistent scaleable growth is the byproduct of PMF, though ROI on different channels will diminish over time.; The first problem is that you’re taking advice from books. The second problem is that it sounds like your trying to sell another software product when the world already has plenty.",2024-12-30T00:26:15,justiproof,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hpa9be/product_vs_execution/
The key to understanding what to work on > validating ,"I’ve wasted so much time the first time starting a business. I overdeveloped, spend way too much time thinking about every detail. Also spending way too much money. Pitch and business plan iteration after iteration. Now I finally have a different solution that just seems to work so much better.

If you start a business. You’ve probably heard the word “Validation” a lot. And me too. But I just had no idea when to validate.

Do I need a fully functional product or do I just tell people my idea? Do I collect feedback and instantly incorporate it before approaching the next person or do I wait untill I have more data?

Now I set 1 golden rule:

“Come up with assumptions that validate your idea and do nothing else but finding evidence that your assumptions are correct.”

The only focus should be to validate your own assumptions. As quickly and efficiently as possible. Example:

Idea: I want to start a brand that sells shoelaces in cool artistic style. With the right influencers I can make it trendy and hyped.

Assumptions:
1. People like customized shoes. So they will probably like special laces.

2. People would pay a premium for “hyped up” clothing items that feel/look premium/sustainable.

3. Influencers would love to collaborate on this idea if I send them free products.

THEN THE ONLY THING I DO IS SEEK VALIDATION FOR THESE 3 QUESTIONS. 

I talk to some people who I think would like this product. I ask what they would pay for laces. And I start DM’ing influencers acting like the product already exists.

Only if all my assumptions are correct. Will I continue my usual program of deck building, product research and more.

I wish I did it like this ages ago.

If you are in the middle of your startup and it’s not really going as expected. Backtrack and try this. 

And if your assumptions are not being validated easily enough. It’s not worth pursuing. ",5,5,"That’s a lot of overthinking. 

Validation can be as simple as getting an idea, and asking some people if they’d pay X money if you deliver it under conditions Y by time Z.

No need to write long paragraphs about anything. ; Validation is the process of confirming that your idea, product, or service solves a real problem for a specific target audience and that there is demand for it. It’s not a one time event, you are always validating whether it’s new ideas, new customer bases, changes to existing things it’s just how you setup your feedback loop and interpret the results.; Does it pass the Mom Test?

"Code, Chaos, and Finding Truth: A Journey to Digital Wasteland","Two months ago, I sat in my room staring at my resignation letter, knowing I was about to throw away a perfectly good backend developer career. Why? Because I finally understood something that would change everything: most of what we're taught about building tech products is beautiful, polished garbage – the kind that keeps you up at 3 AM, your mind screaming that something's fundamentally wrong.

**The Breaking Point**

You know that moment when you realize you've been living someone else's dream? There I was, surrounded by browser tabs full of entrepreneurship courses, market research guides, and growth hacking strategies. My desk looked like a shrine to startup culture – sticky notes with ""MVP"" and ""SCALE"" plastered everywhere. Man, I even had one of those ""HUSTLE"" posters. What a joke. Every night, I'd lie in bed with this sick feeling in my gut, my thoughts racing: ""This isn't us, man. We can't do this bs. It's not who we are.”

Here's what they want you to believe (and what kept me tossing and turning):

* You pick a profitable niche (that bores you to tears)
* You research your ""target audience"" (people you'd never want to have coffee with)
* You ""provide value"" (whatever that means)
* You ""scale"" (while your soul slowly dies)
* You ""succeed"" (but can't look at yourself in the mirror)

Each time I tried to follow these ""proven strategies,"" it felt like swallowing poison. My subconscious would revolt at night.

**The Moment Everything Changed**

One day, I just snapped. Threw all that conventional wisdom out the window. Because here's the truth: I don't want to build for people with fat wallets. I want to build for the misfits, the artists, the code poets. My people – the ones who live for software, electronic music, art, and design. Then came the real questions. When I stopped trying to be what I'm not, these started haunting me:

* What if the process matters more than the end goal?
* What if authenticity isn't just a buzzword?
* What if building something true is better than building something profitable?
* What if our daily frustrations are actually pointing to what we should create?

**Finding My Own Madness**

Then I stumbled upon Greg Isenberg's idea that everything we do is a product. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I stopped looking outward and started looking inward, into the chaos of my own mind. Because maybe, just maybe, the answers weren't in some mentor's PDF guide but in the things that kept me up at night.

**The Daily Grind's Hidden Gems**

Now I question everything I touch in my daily life. Every app that annoys me, every workflow that feels wrong, every tool that doesn't quite fit. These aren't just irritations – they're breadcrumbs leading to something real.

**What's Actually Working**

Here's what I've learned from my time in the wilderness:

* Trust your gut when something feels off
* Build for people you actually give a damn about
* Make the process as important as the product
* Let authenticity guide you before money
* Question the mundane – it's hiding gold

**The Road Ahead**

I'm working on something different now – a collection of weird, organic ways to find inspiration for tech projects. Not your usual ""validate your MVP"" bs, but real, raw methods that might help you find your own path through this maze.

Maybe you're like me – tired of the same old advice that feels hollow. If you've found your own twisted path through this entrepreneurial jungle, I'd love to hear about it. After all, we're all just trying to build something true in this digital wasteland.",12,7,"I can relate in some way. It also resembles an observation from the video games industry: games that are made by the developers because they simply want to create something that they are craving to play themselves become oftentimes all-time goodies and other games such as from big companies that are planned according to a manifold of best practices of effective managers are usually mediocre at best. 
I face a similar issue at the moment. My main expertise is cryptopology and most of the tools that I can wield are means of ensuring user/business privacy. However, last year trying validating my business ideas with these mechanisms I had to face plenty of discussions with possible customers about the actual value of privacy that it will provide to their business and what a possible RoI is and at the same time trying to come up with possible market penetration forecasts. After 4 months of fighting all these issues I decided to not care at all.
I'm convinced that this stuff is useful and I will simply continue building it. Not only due to my confidence but also because it is fun seeing for example a survey service working fully encrypted without anyone having means of decrypting individual answers.; Im number two up vote bro...

Ideas 10¢=12. How do I keep from getting burnt.,"I ideas for businesses, products, etc. all the time, but I never pull the trigger on any of them. Ideas are cheap, & I've never had the money for anything more. Right now I've Got an idea for a AI program, I know what I want it to do, but no idea how to get it to work. I tried using ChatGpt to build it for me, but it didn't produce a useable product. I don't know anything about AI or programing ETC. How do I go about having it made without being charged a fortune or my idea stolen?",0,22,"You are approaching this from the wrong angle. The idea is indeed almost worth nothing, generally. But it's not meant to be ingenious. It is meant to be worked out in much more detail. You need to refine the idea first in your head many, many times until all pieces start to make sense.

Once you are at that level, that's when you need to do market research and see if your idea has any value. No big investments yet ! Just finding out, learning about users, testing hypotheses, and so on.

Once you have it validated and learned what was wrong and what was right about your idea, now's the time to come up with a simple proof of concept. And then validate again.

And only then are you ready to invest into building something.; ""ive got an idea for an AI program"" may be the most common thing said for the past 2 years...; You might need to accept that you aren't the right person to build every random idea you have.

Our startup, we've heard a few thousand business pitches total over the years. We always ask;

What problem does this solve? What do people do currently? What unfair competitive advantage do you have? How will you go get customers? When does it break even?

Then the secret hidden question;

Who would be the right person/team to accomplish this?

You may be failing that last question.

Plenty of people come up for ""amazing"" medical ideas but they have never worked in medicine or pharmaceuticals... so they don't know their idea is legally, ethically, or financially infeasible.

One time, I saw someone try to pitch a business because their work basically gave them infinite air miles... and they wanted to try and figure out how to make that profitable on the side somehow?

A guy with no insurance or transportation experience was mad they didn't qualify for a discount... so they wanted to exactly copy a program by a major car insurance carrier... but you know ""Do it better"" (out of spite).

Trying to use AI to make an AI solution is probably super common right now. But if you don't have customers already, why would they need you... when they could just use existing AI the same way you are trying?

Once a guy asked if he could hire us to write a crypto coin, and then he wanted to pay us in that hypothetical coin... I asked; ""Then why would I need you?""

I get the feeling you are mostly focused on get rich quick, but you can only be that self serving if you actually solve a problem better than the other options... including doing nothing.; You don't need to build it first, you need to market first. This will sort out the good ideas from the bad. Let the market decide.; I can guarantee you that there were likely over one thousand people who came up with the general concept of Uber...or Netflix...or insert startup here. It wasn't that any of these ideas were first, but rather that those who really dove in were both connected to the right capital and had the skillset to execute.

Ideas are almost practically worth nothing, especially if you lack the technical skillset to execute on them. So you need to focus your time on building skills to help you execute on ideas not on coming up with more and more ideas.; TL;DR: Your idea has no value…it’s all in the execution. Stop overthinking and just start. If you’re motivated, you’ll find a way to make it work with no money, I know because I had to.

I’m a first-time founder, so take this with a grain of salt...

When I started my company, I was in the middle of a divorce and pretty broke. My first step? Validating the idea with my ICP before spending a dime. Once I had some initial validation, I found a designer on Upwork to build a prototype for about $800. Then I hit the phones and LinkedIn hard, closing five deals without a product or a team.

I didn’t have any connections in tech, I was a firefighter..so I leaned into LinkedIn. I did targeted searches for devs, sold them on my vision, and sent hundreds of messages. That’s how I found an incredible developer who believed in what I was building and brought it to life.

Here’s the thing: we all think our idea is revolutionary. It’s probably not. The real value is in execution. In the fire service, we have a saying I live by: adapt, improvise, and overcome. My advice? Stop overthinking and just take action. None of us really know what we’re doing, so f*** around and find out! Good luck!; Read ""Disciplined Entrepreneurship"" by Bill Aulet.

Advice on my blockchain startup ,"
Hey everyone,

I’m working on a blockchain-powered fundraising platform designed to make global fundraising more accessible, transparent, and impactful.

The idea is to integrate stablecoins and smart contracts to reduce fees, ensure milestone-based fund distribution, and make the process inclusive for underserved communities and social enterprises.

I’m looking for feedback on the concept, potential challenges, and ways to refine the MVP before launch. If anyone has experience in blockchain, crowdfunding, or scaling startups, your insights would be invaluable.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and suggestions!

I’m down for a quick chat as well! ",0,62,"Have you spoken to any customers? Is there a need for such a product? Blockchain has not proven to be useful for much, and has a bad reputation from being only associated with crypto scams and climate change the last few years. Who is the intended customer?; It reads like you're about three years too late. Crypto has a bad reputation, nobody hypes it anymore, and it has already proven to be largely a fad.

I wouldn't dip into that for sure.; Seems to add a lot of complexity for no real benefit. Who decides when a milestone is met? Or if a transaction is fraudulent and needs to be reversed? How is paying with a stablecoin that I need to buy easier than paying in normal currency?

You are years late; most people have now realized that blockchain based crypto is only “useful” as a speculative asset. It doesn’t have any inherent value or solve any real world problems.; Has the idea been validated by venture capital groups, angel investors, and start-up founders?

How will it integrate with SAFE notes and waterfall provisions?

How exactly will it enhance underserved communities? In what ways will this change the underlying processes and procedures venture capital groups use to allocate funds to allow for more distribution of capital to these groups while preserving venture returns?

How will this result in a fee reduction relative to the use of a SAFE?

I haven't heard any venture capital group say ""if only the whole fund distribution process could be enhanced with stablecoins for milestone-based fund distribution"" nor have I heard any start-up express ""if only I could have a stablecoin-based milestone-oriented contract for fund distribution for my round"" so I don't know how exactly this business idea has been validated. It sounds like a fancy solution to not an actual problem.; I’m curious how you envision your solution makes the process more inclusive for underserved communities?; What is YC 25 ? Stellar community was really good platform for startups.; If your customers are nonprofits, the concept is already out there. Do some reasersch on who is already working on the crypto fundraiser space.  Big nonprofits already have crypto donations. 

What makes yours original?; I doubt there is a market for that. I would move on to another idea. If your really set on continuing I would stop all building and do more market research, who would buy it?; Surely this is just a bunch of fungible (eg ERC20) tokens being created and people being able to invest in the projects those tokens represent. Then the website is just a centralised ""directory"" or exchange of them all?; so already assuming u have the technical capabilities ... i still am unclear on the benefits. fundraising today is achieved today in various ways (bonus: can u name them and critique the ones your target customer urrently uses).   
  
you want to be ..cheaper. that assumes the fundraiser has an inescapable pain brought about through the 1/2/3/5/10% that they are currently paying out of the current methods. is this true? likely not, other parts of the value chain i.e. donors are likely more disincentivised to donate if a large proportion is wasted, that is more a function of how efficient fundraiser is going to be with the remaining 90-99%, e.g. 33% might be overhead for their corp structure, or some is lost to corruption in countries with dodgy governments for example.

you say you can be cheaper... how? the cost of transaction is essentially the error/fraud rate. Stripe have best and lowest fraud rates in the industry as a payment provider, but they still charge comparably with mastercard/visa because it's essentially a monopoly and there will also always be some fraud costs to mitigate. platforms like gofundme are ontop of this and hence costs rise to 10%. in principle a crypto platform could work but in practise what is required/what is feasible. im not following the space but to my knowledge no platform (e.g. bitcoin/ethereum/doge) has reduced end-of-the-day transaction and transfer costs to the users more than the 'loss leader' of a simple bank transfer which is 'free' AND prevented volatility. Most stable coins suffered from volatility until a critical mass, but to get into them how are you going to capture the value in the form of the original donations? - - it will be mastercard/visa/stripe which will have fees, then if value is held in the stablecoin it could only reduce fees/costs if the value is used as collateral to release 'real' fiat funds, or otherwise you expect to create a network of orgs that hold value in these stablecoins indefinitely, which is ambitious.",2024-12-29T16:19:02,No-Fisherman-8894,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hozbz7/advice_on_my_blockchain_startup/
"1 Month after launch, 0 Users so far. What I am doing wrong?","This is not a cheap promotion attempt to get some traffic with a clickbait title.

I made a Customer Support app where you can answer customer inquiries directly from Slack workspace. So you don't have to switch between Slack <> Zendesk/Intercom/Whatever you are using.

In short, you can handle customer conversations on Slack from beginning to end.

These are what I tried for a month after the launch.

* Keep writing posts on Thread and Reddit trying to promote the product.
* Keep updating new features.

But so far, I have no users and I am not even charging the product at this point. :(  
What am I missing? How do I acquire my first users?",49,113,"Why did you build it? Did you talk to customers prior?; Long ago I thought me and my team needed more slack integration. 

Now I think me and my team need more segregation. 

Doing everything in slack turned out to have two negative consequences:

1) It’s bad for teams attention economy
2) It leads to everyone chasing the latest thing like a bunch of 6 year olds playing soccer. 

So to answer your question: as a founder, based on how you explained your solution, I wouldn’t be interested. 

Also: you keep adding features without talking with customers. Why?; A lot of info is missing. Typically I wouldn’t say support teams want to work in slack. Tools like zendesk have a lot of features that slack would be missing. So I’m questioning whether this solves a problem worth solving

Secondly, regardless of the problem you have no marketing. Reddit is not the way it doesn’t work. You need to find out where your clients are and let them know what your doing

Also usually when talking to clients you’re basically building a pipeline so what happened to those people? If they’re not engaging that is a bad sign; If you haven't validated the demand for the product, that's what you're doing wrong. Secondly, your customers aren't on Thread or Reddit, if they are then they aren't wearing the 'your customer' hat. This sounds like a product for businesses, that's where you should be targeting.; What problem are you trying to solve? And where did you hear it from? Have you offer your solution to someone where you hear the problem from?; [deleted]; Was there a pain point to begin with?; There’s friction with any decision to use a new app. CS teams have process they undergo when responding to tickets and you’re looking to change that process. You need to have enough conversations to understand how to deliver the most value while eliminating their concerns for your customers.

You should try to interview at least 20 decision makers.; Why would anyone want to use your app?

In Intercom, I have AI assistant and it helps me to find the information faster in my public articles and my internal knowledge base. What do I gain from replying directly from Slack?

In Intercom I have data about my users that helps me to give them a better answer better suited to their circumstances, and even offer proactive information. What would I gain from replying directly from Slack?

In Intercom I can find previous interactions with the same user, tag conversations, use macros, etc. What would I gain from replying directly from Slack?

Why would I pay for both Intercom and your app, what do I gain by that? What's the problem you are you solving?; So, while I agree with most commenters that it sounds like your product solves a “problem” that nobody actually has / cares about, the reality is you might’ve accidentally stumbled onto PMF, because there’s a company called Slaask doing the same thing:

https://get.slaask.com/

And they’ve been around since 2016

This is good news, because you can  now research their strategy to determine:

1) Their core offer / marketing message
2) Their key marketing channels
3) Their funnel / sales process
4) Their retention strategy 

You’ll still need to differentiate yourself, and it won’t be easy, but at least there’s a real market here - and you have a “muse” business to model after.

And after that, continue improving to become more effective.; Building helpful projects over complex ones is absolutely the right approach, especially early on. Complexity for the sake of looking impressive often ends up being more of a distraction than an asset, while genuinely useful projects show that you understand real-world problems and how to solve them. Employers and investors value impact more than complexity because the goal is to make something people actually use.; if you can break down a complex problem into a simple one I'd hire you .

"Seeking Advice on Scaling Our Startup: Marketing, Cloud Costs, and Attracting Foreign Investors","**Hello Everyone,**

I am seeking advice and survival tips for my startup.

**A Little Flashback**

Back in 2021, my team lead and five colleagues from my previous company decided to pursue an idea for a startup. The main plan was from our team lead. The plan was for the team lead to secure clients and funding while also contributing as a developer. Meanwhile, the rest of the team would learn coding and start developing our product. We accepted that as we all were in IT support and had eager to learn coding.

In 2022, I transitioned into a DevOps role with moderate expertise in Django and helped build a product. One of my colleagues became a C# developer. However, by late 2022, everyone except me and the team lead left the startup. Currently, the team lead owns 80% of the company, while I hold 20%.

By mid-2024, we successfully developed four stable products. We sold the Django-based app to multiple businesses, including two high-profile companies that are actively using it.

**The Issues**

We now have nine employees, excluding me and the CEO. Starting in early 2025, we expect to generate approximately $4,000 per month in service sales. However, we are facing several challenges:

1. **Marketing:** We have not spent any money on marketing, which limits our growth potential.
2. **Expenses:** The $4,000 revenue will primarily go toward employee salaries, cloud bills (AWS), and office costs.
3. **Cloud Costs:** A significant portion of our expenses is related to AWS. I looked into AWS credits for startups, specifically the Activate Portfolio program, but I am unsure about the process. My goal is to maximize the credits we can obtain to alleviate cloud expenses.

**Seeking Advice**

* How can we secure angel investors from abroad? We are looking for investors who understand the potential of IT and can offer reasonable funding terms. Unfortunately, investors in Bangladesh often undervalue the sector and demand high equity in exchange for small amounts of funding, which could harm the company’s growth.
* Any tips for building a stronger portfolio to attract international investors?
* Suggestions on cost-effective marketing strategies to expand our reach would also be very helpful.

**Projections**

By the end of 2025, with proper marketing, we believe we can attract more large companies both in Bangladesh and internationally.

Your suggestions and recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",3,15,"For marketing, focus on highlighting how your existing clients are benefiting through blog posts and case studies targeting decision-makers in your niche. Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator and personalized cold emails to reach bigger businesses, and consider small-budget paid ads on LinkedIn or Google to attract IT managers. Engage in relevant tech forums and Slack groups to build relationships, not just pitch. For funding, explore international angel networks like AngelList, SeedInvest, and LinkedIn groups, and look into grants, competitions, and accelerators such as Techstars and Y Combinator. To reduce AWS costs, apply through the AWS Activate program or reach out to startup accelerators that can nominate you for larger credit packages. On financial management, focus on building recurring revenue from maintenance contracts to smooth out cash flow, and track every expense using tools like Wave or QuickBooks to maintain transparency.; Hi, 

Would you mind discussing your product in more detail with me? I am currently looking for a technical partner to build my own products, so maybe we may be able to help each other. 

If your product is something I am interested in, I may be willing to invest a limited amount in it to help with your marketing efforts, while you help me develop my MVPs, or we can work together. I am also currently in the UK, so I may be able to help with taking it international.

Send me a DM if interested so that we can discuss further.; Could you expand on the cloud cost problem? What AWS tools are you using and what are you trying to achieve? Aws can cost a lot for startups in early stages and if you are struggling with the cost of it it's probably better to get a VPS for like 40 to 100 bucks a month and host stuff there until you got a steady cash flow. Anyway if you share a bit more about the project i can try to give some advice on the cloud cost problem.; Dm me product details. lets see, how can I be beneficial for you.; Hey there! Your situation really resonates with me - I work with quite a few tech founders in similar positions. Here are some practical tips that might help:

For marketing without spending much:
- Focus on where your target companies hang out (LinkedIn is gold for B2B)
- Document those two high-profile client success stories in detail
- Start posting helpful content about the problems your products solve
- Reach out to potential users for feedback (this often leads to sales)

I run a program teaching tech founders these exact growth strategies. Happy to share more specific details if you DM me. Would love to hear more about your products too!

BTW - $4k MRR is a solid foundation. Many successful startups started exactly where you are. Focus on documenting those wins and scaling what's already working. 🚀",2024-12-29T07:30:36,mfrg4ming,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hoqyjx/seeking_advice_on_scaling_our_startup_marketing/

"I’ve been a solo founder for 2 years building my company, now I’m bringing in a strategy team of 6. What should I pay them?","**EDIT 1:** The team is my c-suite, they have experience in the industry and a network. I do not.

**EDIT 2:** thanks all, I’m learning a lot

I’ve scaled to six-figure ARR in D2C and am now leveraging that foundation to build a B2B platform. I’m heading into a seed round to scale D2C further, finish building out the B2B offering, and start piloting it with customers soon.

I’ve pulled together an incredible team with tons of experience in areas where the business is set to grow. Their expertise, networks, and ability to open doors are invaluable—things I wouldn’t be able to do on my own. While I don’t necessarily need all of them to keep the business running, their insights and connections could make a huge difference.

As a first-time founder with limited experience in this industry, I know having the right team is crucial. But I’m trying to figure out the best way to structure their compensation and equity. They’re experienced enough to justify strong offers, but at this stage, I need to be careful about protecting the company’s long-term equity and future hiring capacity.

How do I find the right balance between offering meaningful equity and keeping enough ownership for future hires and funding rounds?

Also, for roles that are more about strategic guidance or connections rather than day-to-day work, should equity be scaled differently? And since we’re still in the seed stage with revenue but not yet profitable, how should I think about salaries vs. equity-heavy packages?

I’m excited about what’s ahead but want to make sure I’m being smart and fair while building this team. Any advice or frameworks for structuring these offers?",16,42,"Best of luck, but a solo founder adding 6 people for a ""strategy team"" sounds insane; Are you hiring these people or would they be advisors?

If the former, you’re making a huge mistake by having your first FTE be a strategy role. If the latter you absolutely do not need to bring on six people as advisors at one time.; advisory roles are worth between 0.25-1% per person, use the FAST agreement for reference. 

if you give up too much equity, you won't be able to raise because your cap table will be shit. Your cap table is your important asset.; Well a lot of this will depend on the KPI you’re setting for these 6 strategy people. If they’re only network enablers, maybe just providing equity would be a good route. But if I were you, I would spend time outlining their KPI and then using that to figure out the right compensation package. 

I’m also thinking that 6 strategy people might be too many cooks in the kitchen, but I don’t know what you guys are doing so I’m not gonna elaborate on that.; Why is this marked NSFW; You will find that ppl with these backgrounds often do not add value at the stage you are in 

I’m on the c-suite for a company that would be fortune 400 if it were not private 

We have messed up bringing in execs so often as well; Hey I see a lot of people criticizing your decision versus answering your questions… and as a current founder / startup advisor / former compensation manager just going to toss out there:

On what to pay — there are resources for this. There are free sources (sometimes less quality because of the price point) and paid ones. Some good paid ones: Radford, Mercer, Pequity — listed in order of price. Radford is $10-$15k, Mercer $7-10k, Pequity $5k

If you don’t want to buy, generally, C-Suites are paid in range of $200-$400k in tech for salary — the rest is equity and bonus.

Equity usually in tech is a 4 year grant with 1 yr vest. Amount for C-Suite is usually up to 1% but, you can always give more equity and it’s hard to take away— so don’t start at 1% if you can avoid it. If these are just advisors not operators, I usually give 0.1% over 2 years and up the grant amount for more work. Only employees or investors get more than 0.3% in my company.

Now in the market, salary and equity vary by role, but really, what varies is the criticality to your business and what you can afford. So as a tech company, for example, a technical advisor is likely worth more to you. However a business advisor in your exact space with customers lined up may be more critical. You likely wont know which roles are most critical until you get moving so IMO I would start all these roles on similar pay and tweak / give more overtime to those that deserve it.

Not sure this helps — DM if you have questions!; Hiring 6 new people as your executive team in this small company is a recipe for disaster

Identify the roles you really need e.g. you need someone to manage all the marketing. Then hire a marketing lead or marketing manager or head of marketing. If that person succeeds in 2-3 years you can make them CMO; I've run a couple startups but haven't had an outsized exit yet. This sounds more like an advisory board than actual employees. General legal guidance for advisory equity is generally in the 0.25%-0.5% range with a two-year vesting term. The reason why is that advisors often appear great on paper in the early days but as the business evolves and the needs change, they're often under-utilized over a multi-year period. That said, in my most recent business, one of my advisors who's also a mentor and provides actual help with the work occasionally alongside strategy guidance, and I gave him, to lawyers disapproval, 3% of the business. If the business was continuing on, I would increase his equity to 5%. So like most things, it's a judgement call. But I'd start low and work into it.; Some good advice in here, I’ll chime in and say:

No matter the title, experience, or salary — design the first few hires you need based on the outcomes you want to create. 

It’s likely, but not impossible, that if you were to hire C-suite members that it’s too much oversight and advisory vs doing actual work. There are c-suite hires you could make which can play both roles. 

For advice in this thread to be even more helpful, you should describe why you think you need any hires.

Edit: even more than the original post. 

Most c-suite members should bring their network with them and that can be a valuable asset. But reality could be you need a head of sales with clear targets vs C-suite members who you hope can leverage their network.",2024-12-28T19:22:33,mad-in-french,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hod1ns/ive_been_a_solo_founder_for_2_years_building_my/
Is it possible to be a successful founder without building a social media following?,"I feel like both twitter and LinkedIn are losing their power as a growth channel. Both have taken a sharp turn towards prioritizing engagement bait and video.

On a personal level, it just feels like a huge time suck anytime I open it and does not leave me feeling good afterwards. I don’t feel a need to build a personal brand at all and would much rather be mostly anonymous if possible. ",56,69,"Most b2b companies still exist completely outside of social media and are more bound to trade shows and personal meetings. It really depends on what audience your product has. I think this is also a huge opportunity as social media is crowded, and getting your message to your audience through the noise is tricky; Yes definitely.

I’ve never had a social media following. If the business depends on my social media as a sales channel, it devalues the business by having its growth dependent on me. 

I have sales and marketing teams to sell stuff.; Yes, we have advisors that have large 8 and 9 figures exits and minimal online profile.; Social media followings are, at best, proxy metrics.; I too am wrestling with this.  I've opted to consider the following...

I am not my company's personal marketing strategy and my social media success is not a mirror of my company's success. 

However, investors and partners want to be on teams with superstar team players.  My social media is a reflection of both how I see myself as well a how I am received publicly. 

So I've opted to view my social exposure as a way to improve my own personal clout and focus on brand equity and awareness strategies that align with the company direction exclusive of this.; The more a social media following someone has the less I trust them. The more they want social media clout the less I trust them.; It’s possible to be a successful founder without attending every networking event and without building a social media following. Networking events and social media are filled with wantrepreneurs (those who want to be entrepreneurs without actually doing what it takes).

As long as you go to where your customers are and build a product/service they want, you can be successful.; I am a successful founder without a social media following. B2B, sales led growth doesn’t care about that.; Depends on the thing you are founding, and where.; Yes. But sure, building a social media following can help with distribution / sales / hiring, and it’s most valuable in media and media-supported companies. 

IMO for most of us it’s probably a net negative that we rationalize into ‘work’, confusing our own motion with progress. 

As a fun data point: I did some contract work for a solo dev building Shopify plugins. He was a former wildlife videographer who wanted to hit 1M ARR to open a new wildlife conservation park. We stopped working together because he jumped from 300k to $700k ARR and needed to hire people full time. There are tons of quiet builders, but our availability bias makes us discount their impact.

It’s easier to be quiet and successful outside of VC where there’s an incentive to be loud, and reputation can be converted into valuation. But even a quick glance through old YC companies shows that the majority of those founders don’t bother building followings.",2024-12-28T19:03:40,michaelthatsit,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hocmmd/is_it_possible_to_be_a_successful_founder_without/
Stuck and unmotivated ,"You read it..... I am stuck and unmotivated. In March, I signed a lease to open my shop. I was on top of the world, after 2 years of planning with a S.C.O.R.E. mentor, I received a grant for my main machine, I had all my equipment, my suppliers, my location, and had an open date for 4/1/24. Our open date was planned to coincide with a large semi annual even across the street from our shop. Everything was finally coming together. One moment I was flying high, and the next, the ground was gone. 

  
Literally everything seemed to fall apart, all at once— 

Our location included 2 buildings. Building A was the main shop with seating. Building B was going to be used as an office/storage - future use will be for take out/drive thru. 

Less than a month after I signed the lease (paying deposit + 3 months rent), I wanted to give myself a a couple month cushion. We got huge amount of rain, and both buildings flooded. The flooding went on until end of May early June. Now we are 2 months past our open date. We live in a small rural area, local businesses rely of annual events for good revenue. Then next event was going to be July 4th. 

June 19th - My nephew (2M), that had been with our family for the last 18 months (long story), was picked up and taken by his biological mom, despite her absence, lack of communication, and against advice of our local sheriff's office. Legally I was stuck - my brother has no intention on being a father or making sure my nephew is safe. When this happened, I remember trying to file guardianship papers, the court clerk wouldn't file them for me, talked social services, begged her to do it gradually so he can get to know her. I don't really remember much of anything between then and mid- September. It hurts me to say that now because my fiancé and our 3 kids (12F,14F,15M) feel the pain and loss just as much as I do. (As an update, bio mom keeps saying we can plan visits, etc, but always finds a way to not show up.)  It's been 192 days.  - Ok back to business. 

July 4th - had no business even trying but we did anyway, we were going to open come hell or high water.....  instead it was ended up being electricity giving us the shock. building A wasn't fully ready so we utilized building Bs large open front area - until not a single electrical outlet worked in that room (there was around 10). Determined to salvage this disaster we move all our coffee pots, warmer, supplies into the empty future ""office area"" very small about 6 outlets but they at least worked! Until they didn't. Between breakers, confusion, and mayor AND BUILDING OWNER trying to talk to me in the midst of this mess I'm pretty sure I checked out and told everyone to shut everything off and go home. 

August - I reach out to the building owner because I know I haven't paid July or August rent yet. At first he seemed fine, and willing to work with me, than he started becoming very persistent about me paying him, I was getting multiple texts daily asking for the money (knowing I still hadn't opened, and with all the BS with the buildings). September I told him I did not want to continue with the lease, he made me feel very uncomfortable, not only emotionally but physically (he would literally look into the shop windows while i was working) instead of coming inside the unlocked front door of his building. It gave me the creeps. Also our county has zero building or health codes ( I know, WTF). 

Now it's almost 2025, my machine I got with the grant, was taken back (because) opening was one of the stipulations), so when they found out I wasn't going to open, they came and took the machine. All my other equipment, supplies, furnishings, inventory are stored in my garage at home.  

I've spent the last 6 months just trying to keep going, trying to manage, the business blocks, muddle through the grief, help hold our family somewhat together though all this, that I lost myself and my goals. Which is ironic bc I usually have about 3 plans, for each decade, for the next 5 decades constantly running through my head. Some days I feel like we are finally getting our groove back and will be able to move forward, than some days, I still spontaneously cry for hours because I pickup up one of my nephews toys or outfits. 

I have no clue what I am even trying to get out of writing this.  I am so grateful for having great kids, the best sister, a safe home. 

I can handle my shit. Always have. I will find a way through it.  Nobody tells you how lonely grief is, or just can't explain it.  ",9,2,"Your words hit so deeply.  
It’s not just the series of events, but how you’ve carried the weight of every moment with such grace.

I’ve had times in my life where everything I built seemed to crumble at once. And even though people would tell me I was strong, it felt hollow because strength didn’t stop the grief, the exhaustion or the fear of trying again.

But one thing I learned is that strength isn’t about never breaking. It’s about how you show up, even in the smallest ways, after you’ve been broken.

You’ve shown up for your family, for yourself and now even on a platform like this, sharing your story so openly. That’s not weakness.  
  
It’s extraordinary courage.

When you’re ready, even if it’s just one small step, that step will matter. And I believe you’ll get there.",2024-12-28T18:52:31,Momof3rascals,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hocdje/stuck_and_unmotivated/
What do you think of SaaS 2.0: Service-as-a-Software?,"A new term has recently emerged in the business world:  
**Service-as-a-Software** a.k.a. **SaaS 2.0**

In general, some authors of articles promoting this term assume that the new and rapidly growing possibilities offered by AI and automation mean that problems that were previously too individual or support-intensive can now be tackled. The focus is on (human) service on the customer side and the background processes in the company are fully AI-supported and automated. Unlike traditional SaaS, no software is primarily offered here as self-use.

In other words:  
**""Service as a Software"" (SaaS 2.0)** is a new type of business model that mixes software automation with real human support. Unlike traditional SaaS, which provides self-service tools for users to solve problems on their own, SaaS 2.0 focuses on delivering results by combining technology with human expertise.

In this model, software handles repetitive tasks like data processing, scheduling, or matching, while humans step in to provide guidance, handle exceptions, or solve complex issues. This approach is often called **Human-in-the-Loop** because humans are actively involved in key parts of the process, ensuring a personalized and empathetic experience for the customer.

SaaS 2.0 is especially useful in industries like healthcare, education, or elderly care placement, where trust and personalization are critical. For example, a traditional SaaS might offer a tool to search for care homes, while a SaaS 2.0 solution would also provide a care consultant to help families make the best choice. In this case no traditional marketplace is needed where the supply and demand side used to be scaled simultaneously. Instead, an AI can now search for the best match for a place in a retirement home and a human in the loop can be the external face for the customer and the retirement homes and thus act as an agent.

By automating routine tasks and using humans for high-value touchpoints, SaaS 2.0 delivers better outcomes, builds stronger relationships with customers, and stands out from traditional software that relies only on automation.

What do you think about the potential of this concept?",0,9,"This is the biggest load of BS, and the type of stuff consultants and VCs spend their time thinking about.

You need to anticipate the problem that a very large customer base will have in the next 3 years..; There's no silver bullet. You have to try different things until you find message-channel fit. 

The only way to do that, if you're starting from scratch, is to test lots of ideas fast. Come up with hypotheses you can test, run small marketing tests, gather data, discard what doesn't work and double down on what works. You may have tried some initial approach that isn't working for some reason. Rather than stress about it, iterate or try something else. 

For example, you tried IG reels for 30 days and got little traction. You can iterate on that channel, perhaps changing your message, or targeting a slightly different profile and see if you find the right match. Also try something else, maybe spend $500 on Paid TikTok ads, using a trending format. See what happens. Keep running small marketing experiments until you find an outlier. Try partnering with YT creators in your niche. Try cold emails. Etc. You get the idea.   
  
 Be sure to focus on the right KPIs!

Obviously you have to prioritize and be smart about your budget, but it's well worth it in the beginning to try as many small experiments as you can and gather your own data--- rather than looking for one silver bullet. That approach will give you greater ROI over time.  If you want to make the process a bit easier, shoot me a DM and I can send you my database of marketing experiments and growth ideas you can start testing in your niche right away. 

I hope that helps.   
Good luck!; Paid ads are the fastest way to get there.

If you can't afford that, work on a mix of cold mails/DMs and organic reach through SEO and social media. You can also reach out to educational influencers in the niche of marketing, small business, retail & ecommerce industries and ask they to do a revenue-share or small ticket based endorsement.

Reaching your first 1000 users is no joke and it's a big milestone to cross 2000, I hope you understand it's not as easy as it sounds.

In case you want a free consultation for the paid ads approach, I'd love to have a chat with you :); Few ways to go about this:

  
1. Cold email campaigns targeting small business owners who need a site. 

2. Cold LinkedIn outreach targeted towards e-commerence brands lacking a site or need a better site

3. Reddit outreach, provide value in subreddits that your target customers are most likely to be active in.

Payment gateway for Marketplace SaaS application ,"Hello SaaS subreddit! 

I'm a first time entrepreneur and I need an advice for the payment gateway selection for my SaaS application. 

The best payment gateway will have the following features: 
- Monthly subscription charge 
- Minimum transaction fee 
- Allows me to surcharge a % for every purchase made on marketplace, that we will charge as a platform fee
- Minimum deposit fee to allow me to deposit the funds to my customer's account while keeping my platform fee that I charged above.

",8,8,"If Stripe is too expensive, consider these options:

1. Adyen

Competitive pricing: ~2.9% + $0.12 per transaction (varies by volume).

Supports marketplace models with platform fees and flexible payouts.



2. Payoneer

Low fees for global payouts (~1-2% on cross-border payments).

Supports charging a percentage as a platform fee while enabling easy fund deposits to sellers.




Both are reliable and suited for marketplaces. Check their pricing for your specific use case!; > I already saw stripe but they are expensive and charging too much not allowing us to make any money out of the platform fee and transaction fee.

As someone who has used stripe for multiple marketplace products in the past and one active project on stripe connect right now - would you care to elaborate on this any?  I know with certainty this is not accurate.; Don’t overcomplicate it. Use Stripe and accept the published pricing. Once you have sizable volumes, then you can negotiate better rates and consider adding other payment processors. But right now, you are too sub-scale for this to be a problem to spend time on.

What do I prioritize?,"I’m building something I am truly passionate about. I love the journey I’ve embarked on, and look forward to every moment I get to build the future I hope to see. I’m currently in an accelerator program in SF for the first time ever, and I’m really trying to pick up momentum. Realistically, I don’t think I’m going to get picked by the VC for funding for a number of reasons: I’m solo-ish (my cofounders are not here in sf or full time), I’m not building ai/crypto/vr, I don’t have crazy high revenue, I don’t have crazy high users, and, to top it off, it’s a social app (ik, tough lol)

Before I got here, I was fairly proud of my mvp having amassed sustainable growth and revenue at the local university. However, this accelerator program quickly hit me with imposter syndrome as I wasn’t doing nearly enough of what VCs are looking for. I’m confident in what I’m building, my craftsmanship, the demand, and the business model to monetize.

I’m torn between making use of my limited, bootstrapped resources towards hyper focusing on user experience, small/large scale revenue growth with customer sales, user growth, fundraising, or hiring a team. I know the answer is usually all of the above, but I need help deciding on what to prioritize on. 

I know it’s obviously very nuanced and depends on a lot of factors, but any advice or help would be greatly appreciated! I would love to give more context if anyone requests :)",2,8,"When you go for investors, and an accelerator is an investor, you are saying that you accept their needs to.  Their needs are high user growth, high measurable growth, income growth, and basically any thing that is measurable that shows growth.  You build an mvp, see if someone will use it, and go from there.  You have growth, now you need the other things.  

“Craftsmanship” tells me that you are spending too much time on perfection.  Investors believe in “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”  It sounds to me like you need to now spend time on income and growth.; If you feel the chances of funding are low

Hardware lighting related idea - need advice!,"Hello, 

I have a hardware lighting related idea that I've been working on for the past few months that I have a working prototype for. However I don't have much experience in manufacturing these at production level or at scale. 

I have done user studies already for the idea that I have as well as competitive research and so far all of those have been looking great. 

I was wondering if there's anyone here that I can pick the brain of for basic questions like where do I go to start producing the prototype at scale, protection of IP etc. 

Much thanks in advance. ",3,7,"Don’t be so rush. Do you know EMI, EMC?
What kind of certificate need to get? For example: For lighting, you need to pass UL or ETL. If it is battery powered, then It’ll be easier. You need to consider your PCB layout and parts select to reduce switching regulator ripple. If you control the brightness via PWM, then select frequency which won’t cause interference. I suppose it doesn’t have external connector port. If it has, then you need to add ESD protection for pins which exposed. If it is ac powered, then you need to consider more, such as how to suppress ac frequency and its harmonics. If it is  wireless controlled, you need to pass FCC. For example,If it is proximity sensing, then how to “filter out”the ac noise is the challenge. You can think how difficult it is to extract weak sensing signals from strong ac noise and also the thermal fluctuations also let your weak signal fluctuate. How to sampling to do FFT in MCU with embedded dsp core to suppress ac noise interference and regular auto calibration to calibrate out thermal drift of your signal.

The above is design part. Now talk about manufacturing: you need to find an ISO9001 certified OEM manufacturer. Usually check Chinese manufacturers for lower cost. But need to wait and see upcoming trade war tariffs. Taiwan an South Korea manufactures are safe bet. ISO certified manufacturers will save you when your product has some issues later found by consumers. They have batch/lot information of parts in your product batch/lot ( from serial number of product ). Do you know how to design test fixtures to test the PCB/ product? Write C code for MCU? How to audit manufacture: do they have AOI to scan 3D profile of solder paste? How they handle QA/QC? Do they have X-Ray inspection instrument ( if you have BGA package ICs, it is necessary).

For IP protection, you can file provisional patent first. It is cheaper and have one year grace period. You can outsource the sketch of patent figure drawings which cost US$40-100 per drawing. You can draw by yourself for provisional patent. Check general guidelines of drawings from USPTO website before you draw.; Hi, working for a big lighting company and happy to help. But it depends the type of product you want to propose. Could you tell a bit more ?; For scaling I would suggest talking to contract manufacturers (usually smaller CM’s) closer to your place of business first, see how much cash you would need to scale up. As far as IP (ingress protection) there are labs out there who can do testing and provide you with a certificate but you can also do a hacky way of testing initially to improve on your design. When you reach volume it wouldn’t be a bad idea to approach a reputable manufacturer in china to scale into the higher volume. 

Depending on the customer base and usage certifications can wary. Generally I would compare with a similar product in the market and see what certifications they are offering and try to match with them on the minimum. ",2024-12-28T08:59:22,huniluluu,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ho1vwe/hardware_lighting_related_idea_need_advice/
How would you search for a small niche? ,"I'm thinking of building a few MVPs for small niches that big companies don't care about, and see what sticks. I wanna do something that would be a good side project and portfolio builder. How would you go about finding a small niche with a unique, big pain point? I have a ton of big ideas, but now I'm looking for small ideas if that makes sense. I don't want to be the next OpenAI, more like my own venture builder for lifestyle projects. ",9,17,"Actually nobody has time to share what problems they are facing! They are too busy with their own life - said one of my clients! 

He used his alternative approach, he started working in the industry, like doing plain operational work, being an outsider you have so much feedback about what sucks and what does work!

Slowly he found one problem, industry has no tool for analysis, everyone was kind of working on PDF or converting PDF to excel and doing their own analysis!

What he did, came up with his own idea, and we built his idea from scratch! And started presenting as a solution, this helped him get paying customers for that MVP, especially people who were too busy with Excel sheets or had 0 knowledge about excel sheets and analytic!

We built his MVP in 7 ish days, and started getting feedback on 9th day!

Subsequently, he built other tools around it! 

In short: If you can niche down an industry and start working, either sales or marketing or operations, you will find way more valuable ideas to work on, being an outsider gives you an edge!; Are you familiar with the mirror of Erised from harry potter book1? Only the person who wanted to find the sorcerers stone but not use it could extract it from the mirror.

This is all about doing stuff, having specific interests, working in industries and understanding operations, basically just putting yourself out there and being open to ideas that flow from experience.

All of the half decent ideas I’ve had have come from either my 9-5 or hobbies where I know a lot about very specific pain points that a community is experiencing. Most of which are not really good business ideas tbh.

If I were to offer up a repeatable gameplan of sorts, it would probably be to target some new hobbies that are interesting to you and then join a bunch of forums and spend time deeply understanding that world.; Have funds to invest into tech driven opportunities ?

Dicey Exit,"I co-founded and bootstrapped a B2B SaaS product as CTO/CPO with my first-time founder CEO brother-in-law almost 3 years ago.

I’ve been doing SaaS startups for years and have seen many things. This one is a mind bender. My BIL and I’s relationship has rapidly deteriorated over the last year as I’ve built the product to be self-service, low-maintenance and low-cost to run.

I believe he now sees me as dispensable and hence wants to get me out of the company. I own 50% shares outright of the company and there are no repurchase terms.

My BIL has been gaslighting me on small things and the drama and magnitude of deception has grown to the point where I decided to resign from my operational role. He’s muddied the family relationships and has attempted to blackmail me to sign a mysterious offer to buyback my shares at peanut value.

I still have read-only access to the books and I’ve seen the sales projections for year-end are off the charts. He’s kicked me out of all other company comms which I understand makes rational sense if I no longer work there, but he’s behaving very erratically. Going off current ARR multiples, looks like the current valuation would be around $5m.

Given I never took out a salary, and BIL cannot be trusted (he owns other 50%, we are fully bootstrapped no outside capital raised), what do I do to liquidate my shares ? I want out even if it means taking a discount and covering closing costs. It’s an EU climate health company and I believe it would make most sense to offer my position to a PE firm with existing EU portfolio companies.

I’ve started to look into options for listing on online marketplaces to find a buyer to fully buy me out, but I have never done this part of the startup journey of selling under duress.

Currently looking for a job in an insane job market as an IC, got the young kids, my wife and I on Medicaid but still need to figure out income to survive while I resolve the startup exit.

Any insights from those who may have walked this path would be appreciated, I’m desperately all ears as the financial strain and family isolation dynamics are not long-term positions i can withstand.",11,18,"Your best bet is to give your BIL an offer based on his own numbers for the future of the company. Let his greed give you your best value. Just don't let it be paid only from funds that only will exist if the business is a success; that'd essentially be him buying you out with a small subset of your own money. Make him dig into his personal finances, and give you a certain payout.; You own the code and have the copyright to the code, at least in the US until you sign it away.  F him, and tell him so.; > BIL cannot be trusted

This is the kicker right here. No one is going to want to go 50/50 with an untrustworthy party.

Real talk, though, you need to speak with an attorney. If what you say in this post is true you might have some legal avenues for dissolving this partnership.; At 50/50 split, this is a real challenge. Bylaws likely prohibit a direct external sale, which, without real control is difficult anyway. 

You may be able to convince your BIL to go for a Mexican shootout: you both write an offer for each others shares, and the highest bidder wins and buys out the other. This is the only way to not end up with a peanut offering.

My guess is, if he won't go for it you'll need serious legal actions or take the pennies in the dollar offer.; I have the same situation with one of my co-founders. I built the whole thing and now that it’s getting traction he thinks he can just hire an agency or worse use the guys I hired to help me. Keen to see how you solved it.; you need to kick him out.

Suspicious TikTok Ad Conversions – Anyone Experienced This?,"I recently ran an experimental ad campaign on TikTok, using Branch io to track events like installations.

After running the campaign for a day, TikTok reported 110 conversions at $0.70 per conversion, which sounded too good to be true. I double-checked in Branch, and it was indeed showing 100+ INSTALL events.

However, I noticed **0 signups**.

I’m also running smaller ads on Instagram, which are converting well. This makes the 100+ installations with 0 signups from TikTok suspicious—there’s no bug or red flag in our sign-in flow, as we’ve already had 1,000+ signups through other channels.

As far as I know, the only way Branch can log these INSTALL events is through the SDK configured inside the app. This makes it seem like someone or something is genuinely installing the app in bulk and then discarding it.

Has anyone experienced something like this before?

(I’m waiting for my Google Play Console metrics to update so I can debug this further. For now, I’ve paused the campaign.)",22,6,"Are you paying for installs, or paying for signups? Whatever the metric is, that's what the service or people you're paying are going to concentrate on delivering high numbers for. If it's a number that they can influence themselves, guess what's likely to happen?; A very personal observation: I often install an app only to delete it without signing up, when I don't like something about it.

If I install an app from some channels it is because I know that I want it, while from others it's because I want to take a look at it. So depending on how I get to the app, the channel used, I'm more or less likely to actually sign up.

Your post says nothing about things like that, about different target groups, or same groups but to them different contexts and priorities. You simply aren't presenting enough data for anyone to tell what's going on.

As a random example you might perhaps see better results if people from some channels just got more information before they're forced to signup, or if you make sure that the ads are delivered framed with a better context.",2024-12-28T07:00:30,AKKAG,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ho09w4/suspicious_tiktok_ad_conversions_anyone/
How to raise seed funding ? I would really appreciate your advice !,"So basically i'm a co-founder of a startup and we actually finished our mvp and we have users that are eager to join , we are adding them little by little so we can manage the server loads, but the thing is that we don't have funding to support our startup for long and we have no idea how to raise, where should i start ? 

I noticed that most of startup accelerators fund are people who work with FAANG, but the thing is i'm a college dropout and i'm just 22 year old, still young but very smart and a fast learner ,i built a part of the product with my co-founder even if i just started learning how to code a few months ago, now i can confidently say that i'm full stack and i'm building even rag systems and i contribute in the software architecture.

I don't know if it's just my fear of being rejected by startup , or i really don't have any chance of raising funds with this background 

  
I would love any advice on this and any help guys!",2,27,"You have paying customers? Or just users?; Raising money is a business transaction. VCs back early founders based on the team.  but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have your ducks in a row.  You need a proforma financial plan for ~5-10yrs.  You need market comps, LTV, CAC, TAM, etc. You should figure out your marketing strategy / competitive differentiation and make sure they align. They don’t need to be exact or perfect… but they need to be reasonable enough to project a NPV return between 5-10x the initial investment valuation.

Thats how you know how much money to raise and when.  Then you shop that narrative and plan around until you find a VC who gets your “story” both financially and product-wise.

There are plenty of templates to start with.  And Chat GPT can help with the rest.  

And if the number you want is <$1 then what you really want is pre-seed.  That lowers the bar for financial planning, but still good to have anyway since it solidifies your seriousness as a founder with Angels.  You really shouldn’t take anyone’s money unless you have a financial plan to provide a return worthy of the risk.; You're way too early for seed (which is >=$1M nowadays), you need a pre-seed investment. Hit up friends and family, and cold email entrepreneurs who you know will understand your product and your market. You might also look at angel investors in your area. Don't waste time with accelerators and VCs right now.

Probably best just not raise money at all at this point, and look into moving in with family and getting your spend down to $0 (many places give out credits like candy nowadays).; It’s relatively hard to raise nowadays unless you’ve already had a successful exit, already have a relationship with vc funds, or have someone on the team that’s very well connected.

Not every founder is ex faang but it does help derisk the investment for a vc since they assume the tech team has at least some idea what they’re doing.

Ugly co-founder breakup,"Hi everyone,

We are 3 founders with equal shares and equal legal rights in our startup (a Delaware C corp). Recently, we've had some issues with one of our co-founders who has stopped performing and we also discovered he lied about some agreements we made within the founding team at the time of incorporation.

Long story short, he wants to leave, and we also want him to leave. However, it's become contentious as the departing co-founder has threatened to screw us up. We incorporated just six months ago, so his shares are unvested (which he is unaware of, as he doesn't really pay attention to legal details). He has demanded half of the investment we've received so far to buy back his shares, even though he is not entitled to it.

We know we can call a board meeting to remove him, but we are almost certain he will not sign the share repurchase agreement, even though our company has the contractual right to repurchase all his unvested shares at nominal value. If he refuses to sign, what are our options other than litigation?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",102,51,"Shares are unvested. If he didn’t purchase the shares up front There’s no repurchasing.  There’s no payment required.  He owns nothing, unless you didn’t make him sign over IP rights.  Refer to the clawback language in your contract or incorporation agreement.; I have gone through this at a much later stage at a substantial size through mediation and then litigation.  Without getting into the details, what you need to do is the following 

1) spend the money to hire lawyer to review the operating agreements and founding documents and then have your lawyer send letter with the terms you want to happen 1) termination 2) anything that can be harmful to the business etc and then he will have to respond legally and that will cost $ and he will most likely go away. 

2) founders can fire a founder at any time for cause; Just a small advise on the side: typically if you need to escalate, it is often a good idea to escalate in stages rather than go all in. So, take a moderate action, see how s/he behaves. If no cooperation, take next escalation step, and so on. Typically, it is a good strategy to show goodwill first (“Is there some win/win agreement possible for us all?”) and only use means of force when all other means have failed, because ideally you don’t want either party to leave burned ground behind. It also would not look too good in front of investors. But, of course, you do not need to follow that if you have good reasons. It might in some cases be better to radically make a cut if the situation eats up your attention and energy. Just note that the first approach is often the more elegant one.; First, get a lawyer to detail this out for them. 

Your board members, I am assuming, are experienced and have some wisdom behind them. They will want to protect their investment. Ultimately you need a compelling case built for your cofounder that highlights the position they are in. You need to present this and then lean into the concept of a good deal for them. I’m also assuming they bound by an agreement including an NDA which is going to tie them up for a certain amount of time. This agreement (assuming again) should have the appropriate verbiage that can be used to submit a cease and desist in the event they do try to burn your business down.; This is more normal than you think. He doesn't need to sign a repurchase agreement, the repurchase is just the company sending a check. 

To make things cleaner for you guys, I'd talk to a lawyer about drafting a separation agreement that re-states he gets nothing, and it'd include a release of claims and a non disparaging agreement. You'll have to pay something for it, it can't be free; 20-40k should be good enough.; Is there an investor or advisor who can talk some sense into him?; Hire a good CA, CS and Advocate.. here you can find a advice with knowing proper law. Consider compliance as an Investment rather then expense then only you can grow big. This all issues need proper compliance otherwise you will be in loss.; Most founders need marriage counseling before they need an attorney. It’s amazing how important emotional intelligence is to creating adhesion, effective communication, and mutual respect.; 6 months? How about dissolve and start new company without him?; These things are fairly common.  Get a lawyer.  The end result is that if there are signed agreements, you can tell him that the agreements are signed and you are following the agreements, so effectively, telling me to F off.  You literally have to be that harsh with people to,get them to leave.",2024-12-28T02:53:57,Critical-Nature-4598,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hnw4z2/ugly_cofounder_breakup/

Christmas cools down the blood and clears the brain,"First time in the year I took some time off after developing and launching my product and having extensive business travels for sales and opportunities the last two months. I need this recharge for the next push of my project.

Funny thing is, I identified the different types in my Family & Friends during the Christmas days:
- the Believeres: they know that you will succeed, doesnt matter how hard or slow it may seem
- the Criticizers: your idea sucks, you are wasting your time
- the Skepticizsers: your idea seems good, but you dont have the competence to realize it
- the Emotional Support Group: they might not be interested in your project specifically, but they have warm words for you

For myself I long ago realized that F&F is for sure not the source of truth as they might not now the sector and specific field, but it matters actually more on a emotional level, like giving motivation and also knowing that people have your back.

Startup Christmas - Pain Point Giveaway ,"To celebrate the holidays in a startup fashion, I thought it would be fun to giveaway the most coveted startup currency for aspiring founders: pain points. 

I will start it off, and feel free to DM me if you have ideas that can *directly* and *clearly* solve them.

Coding:
1. Code like me - The most frustrating part of a lot of AI tools I use, like Cursor, is that it’s good at generating code, but that code often doesn’t feel like, work like, or structure itself like my code. Something that would fix this would be great, but only if it really works and feels frictionless.
2. Create the tests for my code I didn’t know I needed - A lot of AI tools can spit out tests no problem. The problem is if I’m going to the work to think up these tests, that’s half the brainpower. Something that can not only generate tests for me but really think through the tests I need would be something I’d actually want.
 
Cold Outbound:
1. I’m personally a believer in personalization: I don’t want to sound like an AI just reading their job title or a basic LinkedIn scrape. Something that could make an online dossier of info about them I could use could be useful if it’s done right. Why? Doing this research wastes time

Assistant:
1. AI Web Automator Like Loom AI. I see so many tools that claim to automate web workflows with AI, and they all seem like a pain in the ass to use or don’t work. If I had something as simple as loom where I could be doing some repetitive task online, give it a show of my task, and let it rip through the rest, that would be great. How to make this work and feel nice? No idea, but I’d buy if you did. Why? These types of tasks are often one-off, annoy me, and waste time

Communication:
1. My team and I often communicate on Slack about random issues, updates, and info. Something that could organize this so I can easily look back on any topic like a timeline, that would be huge. The kicker? I don’t want to have to search by specific topic, because half the problem is I don’t remember them all. The other kicker? I don’t want a huge directory of topics, because I’ll never be able to find what I’m looking for. Maybe the solution is to have some sort of automatic organization, timeline organization, or automated categorization. To be honest, I don’t know, but if you could make it easy to look back on specific topics, know what’s talked about, and make it manageable to read, I’d be in. Why? It’s a mess to track topics, sort through what’s going on, and stuff gets lost.",2,3,"Final pain point:
1. Often times a lot of my coding time goes into debugging tricky problems, refactoring code to be performant, fixing issues like accessibility, and so on. General LLMs I’ve seen do not do a great job at fixing these problems, probably due to polluted data that they’ve trained on, and there isn’t a solid way to really scan for these issues that feels seamless. If there was something really good at one or more of these tasks, and it worked well without breaking my code, I’d definitely pay for this; My pain points are mainly distribution: smth that searches the internet, and social media(Linked, quora, Reddit, facebook, company pages, etc) and finds prospects or problems companies are facing that you are solving. For example, someone posted like you how painful it is to use Slack and I have a solution that exactly solves that instead of me looking through Reddit it finds this post and comments so I can contact you directly. If there is such a tool i think it is way better than cold outbounds.; Amazing thread! Thank you for starting this. 

On coding:
- lots of my time was spent on fixing framework specific hallucinations: e.g. supabase rpc function, firebase, etc. unfortunately it's something I have to course correct over and over again 

On product/UX:
- coming up with new and novel UX patterns but having a harder time on discoverability and usability because everyone expected a chat nowadays 
- generating nice and different UX remains a challenge, it's either looking too much like any other products out there or doesn't look as well.

The last one is pretty vague but: constant context switching btw distribution, coding and design, and I feel like a lot of context/knowledge are lost from the constant switch and the LLM token limits.

Distribution in 2025,"What are guys think will be good distribution tactics for AI products in 2025 or in general?
I was building tools for AI startups but feel like it is way harder to sell them compared to non AI companies or maybe market is not ready yet for such tools. What are your thoughts for such developer/ai startup tools is it get better in 2025 or it is better to pivot?
Happy New year guys",4,9,"I dont think this will change in 2025. If you take a look at the YC Companies for example, there has been a shift into the direction of AI companies (which is continuing) with most of the solutions you can imagine.   
At first glance, this seems like a great opportunity to see the amount of possible customers rise, but at the same time the amount of open source tools is also rising significantly. Non-AI-Companies may not know this yet, but in my daily life as a vc it seems like all of the AI companies are aware of this and use those tools. For me it seems to be pretty unlikely, that you can build better tools (this is not meant to be offensive in any way) than those open source tools and sell them to those AI companies on a daily basis in 2025. I would focus on selling AI to non AI companies - they are less aware of the amount of free opps. :); selling to startups is a pretty dicey proposition. they generally don’t have money, and to be honest, the startups doing really technical shit just don’t often need (paid) third party tools.

so maybe rethink that part.; My 2c:
- selling thin tools or infra to AI startups is gonna be tough because 1) most of the tools can be built fairly easily on top of the existing open-source tools, 2) the space and models are just moving too damn fast and I just can't afford the dependency right now. 
- I do think AI startup founders could make good seed users because they are pretty open to try new things, but you gotta expand beyond that pretty quickly.

What kind of products are you thinking? As an AI startup founder and engineering trained, I can see myself using well-built products like AI accounting but will never go for langchain or agent frameworks",2024-12-27T21:05:57,Highscorer27,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hnoxwi/distribution_in_2025/

Kickstart my career with startup team...i need help ,"I want to start my career with a startup team. Currently, I am pursuing my final year of BE in Computer Science. I aim to join a professional startup team that aligns with my technical skills. I am not interested in a conventional professional job; instead, I am willing to work hard and contribute as a core member of a professional startup. In this environment, I believe I can get recognized for my work and live the life I aspire to. However, I am unsure how to approach this plan or achieve my goal, as I lack mentorship. Currently, college placements are ongoing, and most students are joining random companies without clarity about their career paths. Based on my goal, please provide suggestions.",1,5,"That’s a perfect ChatGPT prompt to get you started; My suggestion would be the following:  
1. Try to join a founders student club or something similar. Here you can get new contacts pretty fast and the possibility of free support is high.  
2. Try to connect with some people (Founders, Founders Associates, VCs) on linkedin and just ask them for a quick chat. Most of the time they are willing to talk about themselves and their job - so its pretty easy.  
3. Internships in startups can be a great chance as a start. You will work with guys with the same mindset and dreams and connect with a lot of cool founders.  
(Best would be a VC internship, but those are pretty hard to get - startups will do it to!); I have worked for like 5 startups that have failed.  Not the life to aspire to :); You can have a plan and have your preferences, but you will need to show a tremendous dedication to actually execute on it. 

If you say, ""I want to do software for medical industry"" but the only interviews you get are from financial institutions, what then? Are you going to change your plan to financial software?

At a startup there is often nobody to train or mentor junior devs and subsequently, early startups prefer higher seniority candidates (or candidates with a solid proof of capabilities). Now, if you REALLY want to work at a stratup in the field of your choice, the only sure way to achieve it is to build one and if you fail building a startup, you at least have a solid basis to find a role at one.",2024-12-27T17:39:57,defender350,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hnk8xk/kickstart_my_career_with_startup_teami_need_help/
Corporate Espionage? ,"Please excuse the dramatic title, but I have a strange situation with a potential customer unfolding. Our business is primarily b2b and we do business with prominent companies in our industry, supplying them components for their products. Recently we had a company that is out of our country reach out for a quote for a large volume of product. The relationship seems to have started out well with them hearing of us through our great reputation. We currently do business internationally and we have never had this request before. 

As we communicated with them they have started insisting that we send them photographs of our manufacturing facility ahead of purchasing any product and have said that they may also require a facility tour. Our factory is rather small and we have several proprietary operations that would show how exactly we make our products. Because of this we do not usually provide photographs or factory tours to anyone in order to keep our methodology private. 

Is it common place in manufacturing for customers to request factory pictures or detailed tours prior to even receiving a sample of our product? Or does this sound suspicious? ",35,55,"They've mentioned your 'great reputation' and might be placing a large order. 

It sounds like they're softening you up by appealing to your ego and desire for growth. 

Stick to your gut feeling and don't let slip your secrets.  After all, KFC still has their 11 secret herbs and spices.; The Chinese will copy your stuff so fast and start selling it for half it will make your head spin.  They are trolling you and this is espionage.  You should report this to the FBI.    Maybe ask the FBI if they would like to be onsite to arrest Chinese spies when they come for a factory tour.

https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/the-china-threat/protecting-the-cornerstones-of-our-society#:\~:text=Report%20a%20Tip,at%20tips.fbi.gov.

  
Right now to stall them, you can tell them you do sensitive work at your facility and need a list of any person  interested in touring along with scans of their IDs and that photos are not allowed in your facility for security reasons.   If they give you the list, you can forward it along to the FBI.  Getting a list and IDs of anyone touring is very common for anyone producing military parts and only US citizens are allowed in certain areas of the tour.

Seriously, give these spies nothing, they aren't going to buy any products, contact  the FBI now.; Just say no.  


If they were really a customer concerned about your product they would be focused on the result, and if they were a competitor they would be focused on the process. They didn't ask for a small order to sample with like a real customer doing due diligence would.  They put in a large order to trigger your greed and are insisting that if you show them how the sausage is made they'll pay you a bajillion dollars in orders.



If you are legitimately thinking that they may be legit for whatever reason then simply offer a sample for testing. If they're a real customer that won't be a show stopper.  If they're a competitor then they'll be dramatic about canceling an order and then eventually they'll fuck off.



They heard of you through ""your great reputation"" but need to see the factory? I bet you bought the car you drive in part on the manufacturer's reputation and you never even considered a factory tour because it wouldn't tell you shit unless you were also a car manufacturer and understood the process.; We let a major corpo do due diligence on our company as a prelude to a large investment. 

At first I was ecstatic, but once that excitement wore off I became very anxious that all was not as they portrayed. 

After receiving our DD, they declined to complete the investment. 

They then raised $500m so they could compete with us. 

Trust your gut.; I would just pass on the deal.  No business needs one specific deal to close.; As someone who's worked in a hardware business in the past, yes serious buyers will request a factory visit to make sure you're not a broker and meet their quality standards. They may even propose changes to your setup or qa process.

That being said the photo request is suspicious and you still need to protect your IP. I'd decline sharing photos and invite them for a visit, no photos or recording. It's a lot harder to reverse engineer things without photos or other good records. You can also move, cover up, or otherwise hide anything that is very proprietary or custom.; I'm not saying it is or it isn't espionage. Touring a facility is also a perfectly normal expectation, depending on the context. Be cautious; definitely ask for ID as others have said and trust your gut. That said...

I've done big contract buys on behalf of some of the world's most trusted brands; mostly in retail. Legitimate strategic buyers and corporate spies both want access, but legitimate buyers expect you to put them through hoops. 

I've toured facilities (including manufacturing, call centre, and logistics), in the USA, the UK, Australia, Hungary, Germany, France, Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Japan, China (Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR) - maybe others. 

Once I get an RFI/RFP down to a shortlist, and get answers to questions I've posed is usually when I expect a tour (assuming a visit is warranted). 

The types of things I look for in a site visit is proof of their promises (do they have the technology they claim, can their staff use it), how they treat their people, and how they handle sensitive materials (such as partners' intellectual property, customer personally identifiable information, valuable equipment, custom dies, precious goods/input materials etc).

Here's how I play site visits on the customer side of procurement: I always respect others trade secrets (big red flag if they didn't respect boundaries you set or reasonably imply). I expect to be told certain areas are off limits, to provide ID, and to make a firm commitment as to time and date. I expect to go where we are told on the tour and to follow directions. I expect not to interfere with your business. I might test a little bit (like talk to a nearby employee who is not involved in the tour, see if sensitive doors are locked etc), but good strategic buying has respect for our partners.; I would not do this without a signed NDA and contract with enforceable penalties if they do something sketchy.


The ""big order"" might be complete BS to lure you into robbing your intellectual property. ; You gotta guard your peaches. LOTS of people would rather copy than invent.

Treat information on a ""need to know"" basic. Get comfortable saying ""no"".

Them: ""We'd like to know exactly where you put the lines in the code to solve this problem we have, then we will totallllly invest in you""

You: ""Don't jive me man. I'ma charge you pain rate if you keep trying to treat us like hoes.""; If it feels off, ghosting is an option.",2024-12-27T16:46:51,oof_ope_yikes,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hnj0wz/corporate_espionage/

How long should I validate my b2b idea ?,"I am working on an audience researcher b2b. I've been trying on all sorts of channels to validate my idea and I've also got some sign ups for my waitlist.

The question is: How many sign ups for my waitlist until I can say this could be going in the right direction and I should invest more time ?

PS: I got 10+ sign ups in 1 1/2 days",8,9,"How much did you pay per signup? That's the metric you should be focusing on as well. 

Better form of validation (more reliable) is to chat with people on your waitlist and learn more about the problem they're having, how they're currently solving it and if they would pay for a solution/how much. I highly recommend reading the Mom Test book before doing the interviews (to avoid false positives). \~10 interviews should be more than enough to see if you're going in the right direction.; That's a promising start. But remember that it's not just about the numbers, you gotta focus on the quality of your leads. Are these your target audience and are they actively engaged? If yes, it's worth digging deeper. 

I say this because I realized quality feedback early on saved me from chasing the wrong crowd. One of the things we did that helped us with this was getting an audit for Reddit SEO from odd angles media. It showed us subs where my audience hangs out and what they're really struggling with.

A good benchmark could be reaching 50-100 sign ups with consistent feedback showing genuine interest and willingness to pay. ; It's awesome that you already got 10 sign ups. 

There's a saying that if you can get 10 then you can get 50 and if you can get 50 then you can get 100 etc etc.

As the other user said, it might be good to reach out, introduce yourself to your current sign ups and see what they're struggling with. They'll give you really good feedback.

The things you really need to know is:   
1. Context  
2. Pain points (what sucks about their current situation)  
3. What are they trying/using right now to make progress.  
4. Outcomes (what does success look like)

How many waitlist sign-ups are enough to validate an idea?,"I’ve been working on a tool that uses AI to help businesses find the best platforms to reach their audience, generate tailored content, and track leads. It’s still early days, but we’ve set up a landing page with a waitlist to gauge interest.

I’m curious—how many sign-ups would you consider enough to validate an idea like this?

Would love to hear your thoughts!",10,24,"42; Number of signups is useless info. App A and B could have the same exact number of signups, but behind the scenes A might have gotten every user through their free Discord server whereas B had to run LinkedIn campaigns with a total spend of $15k. It's about lead acquisition cost and conversions. How much are you _paying_ per signup? How well is your landing page _converting_?; Upon launch, if you're nurturing between the time you have them on the waitlist and till you launch, you can expect 20% of the waitlist to convert. So if you have a specific revenue target then this number can be worked out. That's the easy way to go about it. But really, launch fast is always the best advice.; Depends on the size od the market, if it's B2C (more signups needed) or B2B (generally lower numbers needed), and how hard you had to try/how much you had to pay to get the people to sign up (CPA). 

Better form of validation (more reliable) is to chat with people on your waitlist and learn more about the problem they're having, how they're currently solving it and if they would pay for a solution/how much. I highly recommend reading the Mom Test book before doing the interviews (to avoid false positives); Honestly, even 100 legit sign-ups can be a good start. Focus more on the quality of interest than just the number.; If that waitlist signup CTA followed a clear communication pricing then you'd have strong signals of validation and even viability. In other words, the visitor saw how much it might cost and was still persuaded by the value prop.

But if visitors signed up with no skin in the game, best you could say is you have signals of interest. And that's okay because these visitors have indicated a willingness to engage. That still presents an opportunity to interview and learn more, which is better than nothing.  
  
You might even use the opportunity to figure out pricing: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccasadwick/2020/06/22/how-to-price-products/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccasadwick/2020/06/22/how-to-price-products/); How many are paying?; Honestly, ask ppl to pay to join the waitlist. $1 each so that we know they are dedicated enough; In case anyone is curious, op is not sincerely asking a question.

 “What if meme tokens could get married? “ My story from dream to disappointment,"At first, I thought the idea was incredible. 

I imagined a token launch platform where people could follow the launched projects, tokens could become friends with each other, and even get married and have children. The idea captivated me so much that, despite my limited blockchain knowledge, I thought I could handle the entire project on my own. I even had a slogan ready: The social media platform for tokens.

I spent the first three months writing contracts, then the next three months learning frontend and backend development. By the end of six months, I had a working prototype. I was amazed—did I really pull this off?

I immediately uploaded it to a server, set up the necessary social media accounts, and after a few posts, I waited.

But no one came… not a single soul. A couple of social media influencers didn’t help either—turns out they were just manipulating their follower counts with fake accounts. Later, I found out that for $200 on Twitter, even Britney Spears will follow you…

That’s when I realized marketing is just as important as the project itself. But I had neither the network nor the funds to do proper marketing. I thought I could raise money by launching a token for the project, but messages to several token launch sites and dozens of VCs didn’t get me anywhere either.

Now, I’m working a full-time job and saving up money for my project.

When you personalize your cold emails to address specific pain points, it makes a huge difference.

I highly suggest you to do cold emailing, it will help you land clients much faster then wasting time of freelancing platforms.; Have you heard of marketing?

2nd: learn business development skills. Read a book about business development; Typically out of country clients are rough because the demand and market can change. Your best bet is going to be something like cold email (depending on what you are marketing). Create campaigns that target niche leads and hyper-personalize the email and subject line. Keep it simple and give them an offer they can't refuse. Follow up 2-3 times. 

Figure out what your client or customer's pain points are and directly target them. Then, solve those pain points and offer some free resources along with that.; In short, you're not sustainable locally and want to get customers abroad to break even.

Am I getting screwed over?,"I'll keep it short. Met a guy whose got an AI startup. I'm building an infrastructure/devtools company. I'm solo, he's got a team. 

We both think there's a lot of potential in joining our niches and targeting an AI infra vertical. So far so good. Now, regarding the equity split, he wants 70:30 (his way). 

The reasons? He claims has more startup experience, business experience and has raised money previously (public funding, mind you) and a team. He also used the word ""strategy"" a lot. He thinks I lack the experience (YoE) and that I give him ""individual contributor vibes"". 

I, obviously, don't think this is fair given that I will put an equal effort into building the company: I'll handle all the tech, have unique insight in the market we're targeting, know our customer profile and have the vision for the product. I may not have the years of experience but I have proven expertise in the problem domain. I've talked to customers, done ""business things"", done my fair share of VC meetings. 

So, am I getting screwed over as ""the tech guy""?",2,19,"I have dealt with similar ""strategy"" guys even though I am myself seasoned engineering leader.

Long story short, I we settled for 55/45 but the good vibe was already gone with the way he went back on decisions and saw the same behavior again, just decided to break up and he realized I was better off doing this myself and kept sending me messages to convince me. But as someone mentioned, things end as they start. If people are not happy with the deal, they won't be able to give their best. Raising funds is not easy for anyone, also its not impossible.

Telling you that you give him individual contributor vibes is already telling you everything you need to know. And you know this. Deep down you know this. Trust your gut and F this guy.

How important is the part he's already got?; I'm an engineer, and my non-tech cofounder offered me a 51/49 split. After a year of building and a few pivots, we started getting interest from some big, well-known companies. But then she started saying I give off 'individual contributor vibes' and that the original 51/49 split was unfair—it should be more like 70/30. She also wanted me to take on an extra role.

We haven’t signed any contracts, there’s no real revenue yet, and I’ve been the one funding the startup. I decided to cut my losses and walk away. Don’t waste your time with someone like this. 

But honestly, finding a different cofounder might still be worth it for you.; just test if he can walk the walk. write a contract that has conditional vesting on both sides. you do your role and he does his role. if he is able to do what he says (e.g. raise a couple mil on nothing but a concept) great if not then ur better off doing ur own thing. easier to learn how to sell than how to build a product. if he’s good he shouldn’t have a problem with it; Fair and unfair are subjective things. 

All that matters in a partnership is whether or not both people are happy with the arrangement, happy with each other and that both or holding up their end of the deal.

There's an old saying.... things end how they begin.

If it begins with friction, disagreement, conflict and resentment... guess how it's going to end? 

Think about every relationship you had in life that ended badly... in retrospect, you realized every time that you should have seen it coming from the start.; Write down what you want from him in return for your efforts and or fiving away 70% of the company. Make that the basis for negatiation and for your contract. If he's only talk then he won't want to sign. 

Then you know that the percentage will need adjusting.; Practically he’s recruiting you into his business, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a plan for how your share, vs his, will shrink. If pushed it’ll just sound like a normal explanation describing normal developments, work put in, shares instead of salaries (where his role ”obviously” should have a greater salary), and so on. 

And he might be right about all of that. You can’t both be equal solo founders at the top. And you shouldn’t walk into this thinking that you’ll be.

If he’s got a business in place, with a team, it’ll be very hard for solo you to be anything but a recruitment; no matter what the actual agreement sounds like. And if you try to fight that it’ll hurt the business, as well as your future in it. ; He has points and you have points. If it’s any kind of a merger then you should makes sure to secure a C-level title in the new entity. Would you be CTO?

You will not be rewarded for effort. Talking to VCs without securities funding is essentially useless wasted effort. So if neither companies have raised money yet then you’re both equal in that regard.

Whose company has a product that’s further along? Would the company be taking your product as the core and building on top of it, or having you work on theirs? If yours, that’s a negotiating point.

CEO probably should have a larger share than CTO, but maybe 2.3x more is extreme. 60/40 is a more typical split between CTO and CEO if you’re truly both co-founders.

All this said, if you think his company is 3x more likely to be successful than yours, then take the 30% and be happy.; Trust your gut.  You already have doubts.",2024-12-27T07:14:32,Icyphox,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hn9ij2/am_i_getting_screwed_over/
How do you handle it when someone on your team 'knows a better way' (that isn't documented)?,"I've built SOPs for dozens of companies, and one thing I've realized is that creating the darned SOP is only half the battle. The real challenge is ensuring that people actually follow them and see to it that the SOPs stay up-to-date. Also, I like to stay relevant and see what's working, and what isn't. Are you using software?Recurring reviews? Automations? ONLY operationalizing key portions of your business? Are there structural methods (staff members or controls) in place to hedge against complacency or hard headed team members? What methods have you found effective (or ineffective) for maintaining procedural consistency across your team?",4,6,"Trust them.; You need a few things

- the SOP itself should be the easiest way for that process/job to be done. As much automation as possible, clear instructions, instructions embedded in workflows
- visibility on adherence to the process, easy access to it, and management around it.; Ask them to write a new SOP showing their better way. Then compare the two abd adopt the best one. Sometimes the direct report is better than you at something.; Poka Yoke: can only fit in one position.

* URL: [https://thestreetsapp.com](https://thestreetsapp.com)
* Purpose of Startup and Product: Streets is a social events finder and events management app to connect event curators, event based vendors, and consumers, before, during and after events.
* Technologies Used: Flutter/Dart, Google Firebase, node.js
* Feedback Requested: Landing Page / Business Proposition Feedback
* Seeking Beta-Testers: No
* Additional Comments: Does the landing page clearly explain what Streets is? (For an event curator and vendor, are the benefits persuasive enough? [https://thestreetsapp.com/curators.html](https://thestreetsapp.com/curators.html); * Company Name: Level Up Time Tracker
* URL: [https://leveluptimetracker.com/](https://leveluptimetracker.com/)
* Purpose of Startup and Product: It's a productivity app focused on allowing you to track your time spent on different skills/activities. It has a gamification aspect where the time put into a skill corresponds with a level for that skill. When creating a skill, you can set the difficulty to easy, medium, or hard which will scale the required xp/time for each level.
* Technologies Used: React and Supabase
* Feedback Requested: I'm looking to get feedback on the app UX and overall idea. I have the MVP built and it works just fine. So at this point I just need some feedback and validation to see what potential it might have. If someone could make an account and play around with it for a few days and give me some thoughts, that would be amazing.
*  Seeking Beta-Testers: yes; **Company Name**: Cauldron Rewards

**URL**: [Landing Page](https://cauldronhq.com), [Shopify App Listing](https://apps.shopify.com/cauldron-rewards)

**Purpose of Startup and Product**: Helping Shopify stores create and manage loyalty programs.

**Technologies Used**: VueJS, NodeJS, Firebase

**Feedback Requested**: Looking for feedback on our landing page. Also looking for thoughts on our pricing – most of our competitors lock basic features behind expensive plans, but we only have one pricing plan, with every feature available.

**Seeking Beta-Testers**: If you are a Shopify store owner, yes.; **Company Name:** Simpl Manufacturing

**Purpose of Startup and Product:** I'm creating a manufacturing service designed for small-batch physical products under one cubic foot in size. The goal is to simplify the manufacturing process for people without experience by handling production from start to finish. This would be done through a newly structured versatile manufacturing facility. The service is best suited for products like consumer goods, custom enclosures, home accessories, and functional parts that don’t require large-scale production or complex manufacturing processes. My aim is to offer an alternative to traditional manufacturing methods that are often expensive and inaccessible for small-medium scale needs.

**Technologies Used:** Currently under development. My aim is to replicate the versatile capabilities of a standard makerspace while leveraging automated systems. The goal isn’t necessarily to produce items cheaper, but to achieve comparable unit economics with said automation. This would allow creators to manufacture products while minimizing the traditional risks associated with small-scale production.

**Feedback Requested:** I'm looking for insights from people who have experience bringing a product to market. Specifically:

* Does this type of service fill a gap in your process?
* Are the types of products mentioned relevant to your needs?
* Does the end-to-end approach (handling everything from start to finish) resonate with you as a viable alternative to traditional manufacturing methods?

**Seeking Beta-Testers:** No, I'm not looking for beta testers at this time. Maybe in the near future.

**Additional Comments:** I want to understand how this concept fits into the broader flow of bringing a product to market, especially for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and creators working on physical products. Any thoughts on potential challenges or areas where you see this being particularly useful would be appreciated. About me: I am the prototyping lead for a facility with over 100 different technologies. I have produced 100+ multifaceted prototypes and have worked frequently with the technologies I intend to leverage. Thank you for any feedback!; **Company Name**: pmcal.net

**URL**: https://pmcal.net

**Purpose of Startup and Product**: pmcal.net is a web application that lets small business track preventive maintenance (PMs) and calibration for industrial equipment.

**Technologies Used**: AWS Amplify with a React front-end, JavaScript and .NET in AWS Lambdas on the backend.

**Feedback Requested**: I have a few questions that I want answered:

1. Do you immediately ""get"" what the app is about from the landing page?
2. Are you able to understand how to use the app (and add equipment or upload an equipment list) without instructions?
3. Does it feel like any must-have features are not included?

**Seeking Beta-Testers**: Yes

**Additional Comments**: In my head, this is the logical step-up from managing equipment in Excel, since it is difficult to setup email reminders or any trigger to check Excel and many people will not check their equipment maintenance records as regularly as they are supposed to. I have heard a number of ISO 9001 certified companies say their auditor wished their equipment management system sent reminders, which was my motivation to build pmcal.net.; * Company Name: PoliTorium
* URL: [www.politorium.com](http://www.politorium.com)
* Purpose of Startup and Product: fostering an atmosphere for respectful political discourse for our users
* Technologies Used: react native
* Feedback Requested: I hope to get some feedback on how to make it more clear what the product is, if you believe it isn't clear. The problem that I am having is I am getting plenty of traffic, but no beta tester signups. How can I improve the list to get signups?
* Seeking Beta-Testers: \[yes/no\] (this is optional) YES! I need beta testers to do debugging before the 1.0 can launch
* Additional Comments: Any general comments on the landing page layout or design is really appreciated! Whatever we can do to improve the signup rate, we will do!; Company name: Vastian Labs

App name: Beyond Perfect

URL: https://beyondperfect.ai

Purpose of Startup and Product: 
I'm trying to help people mitigate the downsides of perfectionism: constant self doubt and indecision impacting time, success, relationships, life satisfaction. If I can help these ""achievers"" stop self-sabotage through reflective and creativity stimulating challenges, I think the positive self-talk will slowly replace the critic enslaving them. At least that's what I'm trying to prove

Technologies used: AI APIs, Typescript web, FlutterFlow and Buildship for mobile

Feedback requested: 
Complete a scenario in the prototype (""Try Beta"") and give feedback on if you identify as someone who struggles with decision-making and if this would help 

Seeking Beta Testers: yes

COO role,"I’ve been offered a COO role with a startup. They have no money yet, they’re just getting started. What should I ask for? What is fair at this point? Some kind of equity? Can you recommend any example documents I should ask them to sign? I never worked for startups and would like to ensure I’m not working for free.  Thank you!",1,18,"COO pre-revenue? You’re a partner. I’d be asking for an equal share unless they have some serious progress and have proven traction somehow without sales.; UPenn has really good documents explaining some of the legal implications of first hires: https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/entrepreneurship/startupkit/

For example, if you are not getting a salary greater than minimum wage, you cannot have less than 20% equity or it breaks the Fair Labor Standards Act. (See Page 7 of the Employment Law PDF). Example employment contracts are also included in that PDF. 

Note if there's already 2 other cofounders with equity, I wouldn't join. This means you might be at 33% ownership and that's really low without salary. Don't let them intimidate you into getting an even lower end of the stick just because they were there longer or even already built an MVP; pre-revenue means they're still at the starting line, basically all work they've done to date is nil.; COO seems a bit early for a pre-revenue startup, but to each their own 🤷‍♂️

If you do move forward I’d just demand the following
a) equity, equal to all co-founders
b) agreed salary once necessary funds are raised

No revenue, no product, no funding means ya’ll are just getting started and are essentially taking the entire risk together as a team.; Equal equity and a salary of x once y is raised.; COO roles at pre-revenue startups are not a thing.; No offense, but how did someone determine you are experienced and qualified enough to be an officer of the company… even though you ask for basic advice on Reddit? Me thinks you’re flying too close to the sun.; Don't join things without money. You'll just keep regretting your decisions.; Would help to know your precise role in the game here, but if you're part of a technical role like building the product, 100% percent get your meal ticket too, man. You should be aiming for an equal piece if they haven't even built anything.; It feels like free labour. You can try at your own time to see if it is truly valid business",2024-12-26T17:46:43,Intelligent-Brain210,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hmtm1m/coo_role/
