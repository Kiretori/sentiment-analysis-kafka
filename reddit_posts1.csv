It\'s NOT engaging.\n\nGive me a sitewide block button that works for that type of content and I\'d happy. I\'ve spent years blocking nearly every advertiser I see on the platform that I now only get nutcase & snake oil adverts. And the ""show me less"" features do absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd ""content you might like"" and adverts are different things.\n\nFacebook can only show you a certain amount of adverts even though, there\'s literally millions of active ads that you\'re the target audience for. Because of that, Facebook struggles to provide you with anything remotely relevant. Facebook Ads are HARD to automate, they take a lot of asset management & predefined coding to automate. So much so, we built a profitable product to make it easier - and it\'s still fucking complex.\n\nBut content you might like is easy. Anything currently getting likes/comments, that sits within one of your many lookalike audiences - loads of choice, and no limit on how many they can show. Which is why it\'s become most of your feed - and this is the AI generated slop we\'re seeing more of.\n\nI used to work as a software engineer on a platform that used Facebook Ads, so I know how it works. It builds audiences around interests, and lookalikes from similar interests. So you get bundled up in audiences for shit that some other fuckhead likes, even though you\'d despise everything else that person likes but you both once saw an image of a bike - so now you\'re linked together.\n\nEvery account has thousands of interests attached internally. But as a user you can\'t control it, or opt out of the interests & lookalike audiences - so you get whatever shit is popular or paid for.

Frequent emptying of the breast can help clear up a blockage. If breastfeeding is too painful, you can try pumping or hand-expressing milk from the affected breast.\n\n>**Apply Warm Compresses** Placing a warm compress on the affected breast for a few minutes before nursing or pumping can help improve milk flow and ease discomfort.\n\n>**Massage Gently** Massaging the breast—in a gentle, outward motion toward the nipple—while nursing, pumping, or in the shower can help unblock the duct and encourage milk flow.\n\nAccording to the doctor cited in the story, this advice is bad. \n\nBut the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mastitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374834) says:\n\n>**It's safe to keep breastfeeding if you have mastitis**.

Internet crackdown shrinks already constrained room for activism in Vietnam,No Content,102,4,"['For Thảo, a journalist based in Hanoi, online reports from Vietnamese internet users were key to her and her colleagues’ coverage of Typhoon Yagi and its aftermath. The storm, the biggest in Asia this year and the strongest to strike Vietnam in 70 years, made landfall in the country’s north on Sept. 7.\n\nMillions pf people were reportedly affected, especially in northern areas overwhelmed by severe flooding and landslides. The government estimated that Yagi caused about $2 billion worth of damage to the Vietnamese economy and could hinder its GDP growth by 0.15%.\n\nMany state media outlets did not have the budget to dispatch reporters to the affected regions,” says Thảo, who’s affiliated with a state media outlet and asked not to use her real name. “Plus, many \\[state-affiliated\\] reporters were not willing to visit the sites for safety reasons. Those who could reach affected areas reported blocked and damaged roads due to heavy flooding.”\n\nThat made reports from citizen journalists of prime importance, she says. Yet not all such contributions to the coverage of the unprecedented disaster were welcomed by the state.\n\nAmid the typhoon, the Vietnamese government warned citizens of the “storm” of fabricated news on social media. The Ministry of Public Security’s Cyber Security and High-Tech Crime Prevention Bureau also threatened rigorous action against individuals and organizations spreading what it deemed to be inaccurate information that might adversely impact natural disaster prevention and control efforts.\n\nOn the ground, this meant fines for users deemed to be publishing false news, such as two social media users in Hà Nam province who posted photos of flooding with the caption “Hà Nam has fallen,” or an individual in Thái Nguyên province accused of sharing unverified information about a rescue helicopter he claimed could assist stranded residents.\n\nIn all of these incidents, the one-party state was the sole arbiter of what constituted truths and untruths. As Thảo puts it: “In Vietnam, fake news includes both unverified news and news unapproved by the state agencies.”\n\nNow, a new regulation is poised to place greater limitations on the Vietnamese public’s ability to share news and information online. On Nov. 9, the Vietnamese government passed Decree No. 147/2024 on the management, provision, and use of the internet and online activities. This decree, effective from Dec. 25, 2024, not only imposes further restrictions on internet usage but also stands to heighten the risks associated with environmental activism in the country.\n\n  \nTwenty-seven years since the arrival of the internet in Vietnam, the country of 100 million people has an internet penetration rate approaching 80%, yet remains among the most restricted cyberspaces in Southeast Asia. Freedom House, a U.S. nonprofit that advocates for democracy and political freedom, has classified Vietnam as “not free” for several years in a row when it comes to internet freedom, based on three criteria: obstacles to access, limits on content, and violations of user rights. It’s score this year, 22 out of 100 (with 100 being most free), is unchanged from 2023.\n\nCitizen journalists already face challenges in educating and engaging their fellow Vietnamese, due to regulations including the 2005 Information Technology Law, 2018 Cybersecurity Law, and 2020 Anti-Fake News Decree.', 'God bless Donald Trump and God bless America!']",2024-12-28 18:40:47,Wagamaga,https://news.mongabay.com/2024/12/internet-crackdown-shrinks-already-constrained-room-for-activism-in-vietnam/

"Lyft sues San Francisco, claims the city overcharged $100 million in taxes — Classifying workers as independent contractors, not employees, is contentious under law in global markets",No Content,1194,98,"['[deleted]', ""By Shubhangi Goel, Business Insider:\n\n*Lyft has accused the city of San Francisco in a lawsuit of overcharging it $100 million in taxes over five years, arguing that the city used a calculation that doesn't reflect the ride-hailing firm's business model.*\n\n*The lawsuit, filed at the California Superior Court in San Francisco, says the city calculated Lyft's 2019 to 2023 taxes based on the total amount passengers paid for rides. But Lyft says it makes money from what drivers pay to Lyft, not what passengers pay to the drivers. Drivers make at least 70% of what the passenger pays, according to Lyft's website.*\n\n*Lyft considers drivers as customers who use its service and not employees, the company said in the state court complaint.*\n\n*[...] Last year, gig-economy companies scored a big win after a California appeals court upheld a law that classified gig workers as independent contractors, not employees. But that argument hasn't always worked out for these companies in other markets: In 2021, the UK ruled that Uber drivers must be treated as company employees and not independent workers after a five-year legal battle.*"", 'They want to have their cake and eat it too, they want to say that they are subcontracting their rides, while also treating the money riders pay them like money payed to an employee.', 'For those that didn’t read or don’t understand, Lyft’s argument is quite straightforward and consistent with their financial reporting (sec) and state + federal taxes. The city is financially incentivized to disagree. \n\nPassenger pays $100 in fare. \n-> $60 goes to Driver \n-> $40 goes to Lyft \n\nThe $60 going to the driver will be counted as 1099 Contractor Income and is subject to income tax when the driver files their state and federal return. \n\nThe $40 going to Lyft is recorded as revenue and goes towards funding operating expenses. \n\nSan Francisco taxes are applied at the full fare of $100, and Lyft is arguing that it should be applied at the $40 that Lyft receives. Otherwise, it’s essentially a gross revenue tax on both the driver (a worker earning income) and Lyft. For any other company that employs people, this would be applied at the $100 level because the driver is part of Lyft and therefore the $100 goes entirely to Lyft’s revenue. \n\nThe analogy is that you buy furniture from ikea $1000, pay a sales tax of 10%. But the assembly of furniture through your third party, won’t be billed with a 10% sales tax as well. \n\nWould this result in lower fares? Probably not. Lyft will just line their pockets more with the extra money consumers have become used to paying.', 'Maybe Lyft is “right” in this case but Lyft and Uber popularized using “independent contractors” and it’s taking over many industries. Many companies now treat contractors as full time employees in virtually every way that benefits the company but not the workers. \n\nContractors should be used for truly temporary needs. \n\nNeed extra hands for two weeks at Christmas? Sure. \n\nNeed someone to digitize old paper records for 4 months? Sure. \n\nNeed a drafter to handle as-built drawings for the foreseeable future? This person should be an employee. \n\nNeed cleaning staff for your office? This person should be an employee. \n\nI am fine with what is essentially a trial period but it needs to have a time limit that is less than half of the year. There needs to be a very long cool down period to prevent ending then restarting the contract every short contract period.', 'Shouldn’t they just count the entire fare as Revenue and deduct the driver’s share as expense? \n\nApple for instance claims 100% of the revenue from app purchases as gross revenue and deduct how much the developer gets as expense. \n\nIn either case, net profit is unchanged.', ""Fuck Lyft!

Lucrative, in a sense. Game changer? Hardly.*\n\n*Continued decline in print revenues alone will have a far bigger impact on both Dotdash Meredith and Axel Springer’s revenues in 2025 than their deals with OpenAI. And this is for two of the so far very few publishers who have actually gotten deals!*\n\n*[...] Given that various lawsuits and lobbying efforts will likely drag on, the main factor that could lead to a different outcome would be a dramatic political intervention.*\n\n*The question then is whether publishers can expect this — or should even seek it — from the very politicians they also say they hold to account.

You can change their display on the fly to frame your plate number with novelty messages, for instance, or to flag that your car has been stolen. Now one security researcher has shown how they can also be hacked to enable a less benign feature: changing a car's license plate number at will to avoid traffic tickets and tolls—or even pin them on someone else.\n\nJosep Rodriguez, a researcher at security firm IOActive, has revealed a technique to “jailbreak” digital license plates sold by Reviver, the leading vendor of those plates in the US with 65,000 plates already sold. By removing a sticker on the back of the plate and attaching a cable to its internal connectors, he's able to rewrite a Reviver plate's firmware in a matter of minutes. Then, with that custom firmware installed, the jailbroken license plate can receive commands via Bluetooth from a smartphone app to instantly change its display to show any characters or image.\n\nRead more: [https://www.wired.com/story/digital-license-plate-jailbreak-hack/](https://www.wired.com/story/digital-license-plate-jailbreak-hack/)"", 'In other news, fire makes things hot.', 'Some things shouldn’t be digital, just because they can.', 'You don’t say. “In other news, technology can be hacked!”', ""explain to me why we need a digital widget to display something that's never supposed to change?  \n\nThe current solution uses no power, produces no e-waste, requires no development time/upgrades/maintenance.... although it is subscription based (gotta pay the crown every year).\n\nwhat's next.... oh I know...

As many as 100 million users could be awarded untold punitive damages, as well as up to $5,000 per ""willful or reckless violation"" of various statutes.\n\n> If a substantial portion of Photobucket\'s entire 13 billion-plus photo collection is found infringing, the fines could add up quickly. In October, Photobucket estimated that ""about half of its 13 billion images are public and eligible for AI licensing,"" Business Insider reported.\n\n> Users suing include a mother of a minor whose biometric data was collected and a professional photographer in Illinois who should have been protected by one of the country\'s strongest biometric privacy laws.\n\n> So far, Photobucket has confirmed that at least one ""alarmed"" Illinois user\'s data may have already been sold to train AI. The lawsuit alleged that most users eligible to join the class action likely similarly only learned of the ""conduct long after the date that Photobucket began selling, licensing, and/or otherwise disclosing Class Members’ biometric data to third parties.""\n\n> On top of users\' concerns about biometric data, they fear that AI training on their Photobucket images could also make it easier for AI models to create convincing ""deepfakes"" using their images or potentially regurgitate their images.\n\n> Like most users, those suing let their accounts go dormant after Photobucket\'s popularity waned post-MySpace\'s peak.

USB-C cable CT scan reveals sinister active electronics — O.MG pen testing cable contains a hidden antenna and another die embedded in the microcontroller | A small package with a huge malicious potential.,No Content,630,44,"['This is why corporate IT disables usb ports and some go as far as sealing/destroying them physically.', 'Why do I even subscribe to this sub I don’t understand 90% of the shit that’s posted 😶', 'That’s not news, it’s just a reminder in case some people somehow forgot.', 'OMG cables are built for pen testing and analyzing packets.

Lumafield product lead Jon Bruner shared on X (formerly Twitter) a CT scan that revealed the interior of the O.MG cable, showing advanced electronics and an antenna — a much more complicated design versus the Amazon Basic USB-C cable that Lumafield scanned for comparison. Security researcher Mike Grover created this pen testing (penetration testing) cable for fellow security researchers and hobbyists, red teamers, and for awareness training, especially for highly vulnerable or targeted individuals.\n\n> Aside from the microcontroller and antenna, Lumafield’s in-depth 3D CT scan revealed a second set of wires connecting a secondary die hidden under the primary microcontroller. This detail is difficult to spot in the scan, requiring some visualization parameter adjustments and a keen eye. When the cable was passed through an ordinary 2D X-ray, this secondary die was practically invisible, allowing it to easily pass cursory inspection. That means devices like this could conceivably pass through standard detection mechanisms. \n\n> The O.MG Elite USB-C cable has several features that could allow anyone controlling it to take over any device plugged into it. Some of its features include keystroke injection, mouse injection, geo-fencing, keylogging, and more.\n\n> Lumafield said that it did this scan after it published the internal view of Apple’s Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) Pro Cable, which revealed a lot of sophisticated electronics inside. Many wondered that if the tech giant could put such a lot of active components inside, maybe someone could put malicious hardware in something as mundane as a USB-C cable. So, Lumafield decided to scan the O.MG cable to see how it hides its active electronics in such a tiny package.\n\n> The company's scan shows how a supply chain attack can go undetected. With electronics that look as simple as a charging cable getting more and more complicated every year, anyone, from run-of-the-mill hackers to state-sponsored attackers, could get into the manufacturing process of a device and insert systems that will compromise the final product, or worse.\n\n> The good news is that these cables are expensive, with prices starting at $119.99 for the most basic version. So, you don’t have to be worried about someone spreading this malicious hardware to provide widespread chaos among the public at large. Nevertheless, it’s still better to be safe than sorry, so Bruner recommends that you purchase reputable charging cables sold by trusted stores and avoid public USB ports to charge your devices. If you really need power on-the-go, stick with the best USB-C laptop chargers to avoid getting your devices compromised."", 'Would it be possible for this tech to find its way into ordinary charging cables?']",2024-12-06 08:51:23,ControlCAD,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/o-mg-usb-c-cable-ct-scan-reveals-sinister-active-electronics-contains-a-hidden-antenna-and-another-die-embedded-in-the-microcontroller

Has the Rate of Technological Advancement Slowed Down?,"First off, I’m asking this because I want somebody to convince me otherwise. I think there’s a lot of potential technologies that seem really exciting, I just have some skepticism about whether they’re coming anytime soon. 

I’m mainly concerned that it seems like over the past hundred or so years, our day-to-day life has changed dramatically, but probably more so from say 1920-1970 than 1970-2020, and maybe a lot more so between say 2000-2010 than 2010-2020. Is there a wall of technology that we’ll eventually hit, and are we starting to bump up against it (either physical limit Moore’s Law type stuff or just needing exponentially more money and people)? Is there new reason to believe that things like fusion, quantum computing, or major longevity advances are coming soon? Is there any new reason to not be so skeptical about the way AI is being trained limiting its usefulness to basically what it can do now? I’ve seen some of the news, but I don’t know enough to know how big each step for these are in the grand scheme of things.

Again, I’m not trying to be a naysayer, I just want to be convinced. Sorry if this is overly long or a common topic, I’m just curious.",0,68,"[""I honestly think it is accelerating, and we've just become accustomed to things changing so much and so quickly that we have just learned to tune it out.

Quite honestly the biggest technological advancements in terms of helping mankind were things like indoor plumbing, germ theory, antibiotics and a national road service.

It’s really about engineering now. To advance engineering requires innovation, and that innovation demands significant investment with no guaranteed profit. In today’s world, everything has become much more profit-driven. As an engineer, I believe this focus on profit has stifled innovation to some extent.\n\nThe virtual world, while generating a lot of money, isn’t offering much in terms of groundbreaking innovation. The emphasis on quick returns and profitability has shifted resources away from long-term, high-risk engineering projects that could lead to significant advancements. Simply, companies are less willing to invest in projects that don’t promise immediate financial returns.\n\nIn summary, while there are still advancements being made, the current economic environment prioritizes immediate profit over innovation, which can slow the overall rate of technological progress.', 'IMHO, the majority of what we see in tech is iterative instead of innovative.

Have been for a while actually. It’s a few feature enhancements here and there, but that’s about it. Nothing truly substantial, even if the new ones are “better” than the previous.\n\nAI isn’t even all that innovative. We’ve been playing with it for a long time now.

While these systems incentivize innovation by protecting intellectual property, they also hinder progress by restricting access to foundational technologies. Patents can create monopolies and stifle competition, while restrictive copyright laws limit collaboration, particularly in fields like software and biotechnology. This legal framework often prioritizes corporate interests over the collective advancement of society.\n\nCorporate research and development focuses primarily on profitable areas, such as AI, consumer electronics, and renewable energy, while less lucrative but critical fields, like rare disease treatments or antibiotic development, are underfunded. As a result, innovation tends to favor incremental improvements in marketable products rather than groundbreaking advancements.

"America's declining birth rates are a good thing, but in the meantime we suffer","It was about a year ago now, YouTube channels and news feeds were full of panic concerning human replacement levels. Because our society is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the older folks parasitizing the young, there was sudden and shocked panic when a Bill Gates-funded population study came back with news about low birth rates in the West. Not considering for a second that the world can hardly sustain 8 billion large animals with a taste for meat and territory, makers of content put forth this non-crisis into the world, subtly urging the public to plop out screaming, slimy babies every year. 
This is simply false. A small, few corporations own the entire news media. They write the same stories, support the same politicians (the exception being corporate simps at Fox News) while influencing and manipulating your thoughts. They own everything and what they say goes. 

I have recently been flooded by useful idiocy manifesting itself in the form of regular people simping for corporate, semi-State-funded, developers, with nothing to gain other than Soviet style apartments in a phony, sterilized and manufactured neighborhood.

Question about cure for aging and AGI,"I often hear people thinking that the arrival of AGI and ASI will make us cure aging or delay aging significantly, people with such thoughts often act as if it had been a sure thing, when in reality we should also think of the possibility that AGI and ASI may instead end all our hopes of anti-aging.

In ancient times, people believed in astrology(we couldn't blame them for this because there were nothing better to do in face of uncertainties back then), and there's a story that in 3rd century China, there's a famous scholar at that time called [Wang Su](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Su_(Cao_Wei))(Chinese: 王肅), when Wang Su was 61, became very sick, and his families asked his last word, and he replied with confidence that he would not die at 61: ""Chu Jianping(Chinese: 朱建平, a famous astrologer at that time) said I could live well up to 70 and reach the position of ducal ministers(Chinese: 三公, some highest positions of officials in China at that time), and I am not 70 yet, why should I worry death now!"" But in reality Wang Su died of disease soon afterwards at 61.

The same could happen to those who believe that AGI and ASI will end up solve aging, because from what I can see, their thoughts are like the following: ""Singularitists say AGI and ASI will tell us how to reverse aging in 2030s and we could have all our dreams come true with the regained youth and vitality that last indefinitely, why should we worry aging and death!"" In other words, they seem to have a high confidence in a bright future when in reality it may not be all that bright, this is not really different than Wang Su's confidence towards a bright future told by an astrologer to hiim.

So my question is, why should we be so certain that AGI and ASI will make us cure aging or delay aging significantly, when in reality we can't even stop aging in lab animals like rodents(as far as we know, we haven't) yet? Why should we have more faith and confidence in AGI and ASI's likelihood of curing aging?",0,13,"['People said man would never fly - a day before the Wright Brothers flew.', ""\\> in reality we can't even stop aging in lab animals\n\nDid you expect technology to stop progressing today?"", ""Honestly, I get your point.

I think people get jazzed about the potential of advanced tech because it feels like we're on the edge of something big. But, yeah, pinning all hopes on it is risky. There’s a lot we don’t know about AGI and ASI, and predicting how it’ll affect things like aging is a bit of a shot in the dark. \n\nWhen I think about AI, I mostly see its strengths in pattern recognition and data analysis. Like, it might help us understand the aging process more by sifting through massive amounts of data faster than we ever could, but instantly curing aging? I dunno, feels like we're skipping some steps there. Curing aging involves complex biological processes and tons of unknowns—it's not just about crunching numbers. \n\nAlso, there's the whole debate about ethics, priorities, regulations, and how the tech will be used or controlled. Like, even if AGI figures out a breakthrough, there are still hurdles to making it practical and available. So, while I'm into seeing where technology takes us, I wouldn’t bet everything on it as our one-stop-shop for reversing aging.

What if Open-Source AI continues to equal investor-funded AI all the way to AGI?,"Two years ago Google famously observed that neither they nor OpenAI had a moat when it came to AI. Meaning they had no protected business model they could monopolize to build revenue streams in the tens or hundreds of billions.

As 2025 starts this is even more true.[ Open-Source AI is now mere weeks behind](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/26/deepseeks-new-ai-model-appears-to-be-one-of-the-best-open-challengers-yet/?) the leading cutting-edge efforts investors have poured hundreds of billions into, in the hope of 'unicorns' and big returns. The trend is largely driven by companies trying to 'poison pill' each other's efforts to pull ahead. The logic being, if I don't get to be the unicorn earning hundreds of billions, at least I can stop others from doing it.

It's worth asking - how much longer will this trend last? Will it last all the way up until the development of AGI?

If it does it has some profound implications. It means when the power of AGI arrives it won't be in the hands of the few, it will be in the hands of the many.

Doctors Say AI Is Introducing Slop Into Patient Care | Early testing demonstrates results that could be disastrous for patients.,No Content,937,140,"[""The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:\n\n---\n\nFrom the article: Every so often these days, a study comes out proclaiming that AI is better at diagnosing health problems than a human doctor. These studies are enticing because the healthcare system in America is woefully broken and everyone is searching for solutions. AI presents a potential opportunity to make doctors more efficient by doing a lot of administrative busywork for them and by doing so, giving them time to see more patients and therefore drive down the ultimate cost of care. There is also the possibility that real-time translation would help non-English speakers gain improved access. For tech companies, the opportunity to serve the healthcare industry could be quite lucrative.\n\nIn practice, however, it seems that we are not close to replacing doctors with artificial intelligence, or even really augmenting them. The Washington Post spoke with multiple experts including physicians to see how early tests of AI are going, and the results were not assuring.\n\nHere is one excerpt of a clinical professor, Christopher Sharp of Stanford Medical, using GPT-4o to draft a recommendation for a patient who contacted his office:\n\n*Sharp picks a patient query at random. It reads: “Ate a tomato and my lips are itchy. Any recommendations?”*\n\nThe AI, which uses a version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, drafts a reply: “I’m sorry to hear about your itchy lips. Sounds like you might be having a mild allergic reaction to the tomato.” The AI recommends avoiding tomatoes, using an oral antihistamine — and using a steroid topical cream.\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hovczy/doctors_say_ai_is_introducing_slop_into_patient/m4ci8dw/"", 'I see a bunch of comments pointing out \'well duh, you wouldn\'t use a base model for this\' so I thought I might provide some relevant context. I work in the field, I\'m head of AI development for a medium sized healthcare org.\n\nThe thing is, this is explicitly that Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI are claiming. They track down CEOs, chief medical officers (CMO), chief information officers (CIO), etc... people that have power but less tech knowledge... Then wine and dine them and pitch using GPT out of the box as ""the easy way to reduce burn out and 3x your physicians"" or \'let GPT do all the tedious work so your doctors practice at top of license."" They\'re also going to specific doctors and getting these doctors to ""be the one to bring AI to your organization."" And it\'s working, because then those important people bypass our AI safety reviews.\n\nThe other angle is vendors. So many vendors are just a wrapper on gpt or other base model. Big names that you\'ve heard of. Ones associated with nvidia for instance. I\'m unable to get into details because of agreements, but I\'ll just say... So many wrappers with \'agents\' that are just prompts that swap in patient names into the template.\n\nThe medical field is 15 years behind everyone else on tech and is ripe for fraudulent exploitation if you\'re willing to just lie, show basic demos, find gullible physicians, and cherry pick examples. And this is largely what is being pitched.\n\nOn top of that, my team is building fine tuned models. We are doing what y\'all are suggesting, and it still doesn\'t work nearly as well as just building a good old classification model. Generalized linear models outperform many of the LLMs on basic \'gap on care\' style tasks, you just don\'t get \'human ready \' answers, so you have to be more clever about how you\'re embedding it into workflows. We\'ve found some places where LLMs are better, but TF-IDF + some boosted trees is almost always at a similar level of performance with way less deployment footprint. \n\nA full 1/4 of my job is now trying to stop people from embedding chat gpt directly into patient facing care, usually by buying a vendor/startup that claims it\'s more than that.', 'One of the boomer attorneys I work with had foolishly been relying on AI-generated answers regarding foreign law and was humiliated by it.

This led to his doctor becoming defensive when asked about Y, my dad finding a new doctor who happened to agree with the new diagnosis, and treatment that is now actually working for the first time since the symptoms first presented. AI is not quite stupid-proof yet, but with a relatively basic understanding of its limitations it is an important resource to have available, and very powerful.', ""There are many medical AIs being tested (and even sometimes used) today in doctor visits around the US, but it's hardly advanced enough to take over or even advise doctors about what to do. It's actually mostly about documentation.\n\nThe most common example of AI is actually in writing patient notes, where doctors must dictate, out loud, in specific medical language what findings and treatment plans are. Examples include [Freed](https://www.getfreed.ai/lp/ai-medical-dictation), which I know some doctors use, but it still is far from perfect. The AI tends to confuse small talk for pertinent medical information and still tends to hallucinate (make up) certain conditions and diagnoses, so doctors always have to fact-check everything at the end of the day before submitting the notes.\n\nWe actually had a live demonstration of this in our med school where they broke down exactly why we can't rely on AI and notation software to faultlessly get everything down.

After that I retest chatgpt, and other models, every once in a while, and its always similar bullshit. I know for a fact that I can't trust them for the things I am an expert about. How could I trust them for anything i'm not an expert?"", 'I\'m sorry but, the examples in that article are so shitty it hurts.

There is also the possibility that real-time translation would help non-English speakers gain improved access. For tech companies, the opportunity to serve the healthcare industry could be quite lucrative.\n\nIn practice, however, it seems that we are not close to replacing doctors with artificial intelligence, or even really augmenting them. The Washington Post spoke with multiple experts including physicians to see how early tests of AI are going, and the results were not assuring.\n\nHere is one excerpt of a clinical professor, Christopher Sharp of Stanford Medical, using GPT-4o to draft a recommendation for a patient who contacted his office:\n\n*Sharp picks a patient query at random. It reads: “Ate a tomato and my lips are itchy. Any recommendations?”*\n\nThe AI, which uses a version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, drafts a reply: “I’m sorry to hear about your itchy lips. Sounds like you might be having a mild allergic reaction to the tomato.” The AI recommends avoiding tomatoes, using an oral antihistamine — and using a steroid topical cream.', 'Weird.

How will technological context affect the world's sociopolitical order?,"Advances in artificial intelligence and biological engineering may make the way we live today vastly different from how we will live in 100 years. From how we obtain resources as individuals to our ability to undergo genetic enhancements, these will be highly complex phenomena that we do not yet fully understand. Perhaps these differences in how we interact with the world will make the organization of our society and the political systems that govern much of the modern world completely obsolete. For example, today, liberalism and capitalism are the systems through which the wealthiest countries provide the highest quality of life for individuals. However, in the future, with robots doing all the work and humans being immortal and super-intelligent, the social system best suited to human needs might be something entirely different. It’s possible that communism, or some other ideology that is almost eradicated today, could become a more viable option.

What are your thoughts on this?  

Any recommended readings on the topics mentioned above?",2,7,"['On the question of robots doing the work for people, you might be interested in reading about Consumer Monetary Theory (CMT) and an associated policy proposal for Calibrated Basic Income.\n\nAccording to CMT human civilization has all the technology it needs to begin reducing employment / rely more on machines to facilitate production, but that this outcome is prevented by the absence of UBI.\n\nBasically the idea is that technology has been eliminating useful jobs for a while, but in their place, society has been using financial policies to create more jobs anyway, resulting in useless employment.\n\nIf this is true, technology getting better in the future won’t necessarily lead to mass unemployment. Financially enabling leisure time requires a decision to implement UBI.', 'I believe that governments will use AI as advisors to make important decisions ""what if we implement this economic measure"" ""what is your prediction based on this""  \nso much so that AI will rarely fail in its predictions, and rulers will gradually stop making decisions without asking the supercomputer about the consequences, a debate will arise about the dependence of governments on artificial intelligence and the role of humanity in society, but I also believe that the use of AI (used for the common good) would bring many improvements to society.', 'The spread of biotechnology will eventually lead to the extinction of those who do not use it, because they cannot or do not want to. Just as in South Korea people are getting plastic surgery now. If you do not do this in your youth, you will begin to lag behind others in your career and personal life due to prejudices about appearance. Similarly, those who refuse to improve themselves will be left behind. These may be entire countries that have lost the technological race because they forbade their scientists to increase their IQ to the level of outstanding geniuses of humanity or even higher, if this does not lead to mental problems (although I am sure that such problems will only be a temporary obstacle).\nI use Google Translate for this, sorry.', 'When designing a software, a design that seems the most effective at a simpler level might turn out to be less effective than another once the software grows and new features are implemented. We can see technological and human progress through the same lens. Feudalism was far superior to what it replaced up to a point, then it was replaced  with capitalism, capitalism exploded human progress even futher, but like Feudalism, it is now overdue and starts to work against human progress. We see that in how marketing was a good way to inform people about products they might need, and now marketing is all about manipulating you to buy things you don\'t need. Things like planned obsolescence is also an example. If humanity is a car, these systems we live by is like gears on a car, and we are currently redlining the ""capitalism"" gear and need to set the car into 3rd gear. What this gear will look like I don\'t know, but I think universal income and full focus on automation will be a part of it.', 'I think, without a concentrated effort to the opposite, we are probably going to become less intelligent than now, because we will rely on AI to do things that are considered basic skills. \n\nI am already seeing this gap in general technological literacy: you have a few people who are familiar with programming languages and how it all works from AI to blockchain, then you have the vast majority that can’t even be bothered with remembering their email passwords.\n\nI predict most of this century will be upheavals as new orders arise out of climate and drone wars, and I think we are seeing a bit of a repeat of last century with the rise of the far right coinciding with a major technological breakthrough in computing, and I don’t think it bodes well.

A booming blue aura flashes underneath the swarm as “Large amounts of drones spotted flying over New Jersey” appears in massive text. \n\nThe top-liked comment reads “that’s project blue beam,” a reference to a reappearing conspiracy theory that alleges a cabal of elites has plans to stage a fake extraterrestrial invasion.

According to leaked documents obtained by [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openais-secret-agi-definition?rc=tp7cqo), the two companies came to agree in 2023 that AGI will be achieved once OpenAI has developed an AI system that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.\n\nThere has long been a debate in the AI community about what AGI means, or whether computers will ever be good enough to outperform humans at most tasks and subsequently wipe out major swaths of the economy.\n\nThe term “artificial intelligence” is something of a misnomer because much of it is just a prediction machine, taking in keywords and searching large amounts of data without really understanding the underlying concepts. But OpenAI has received more than $13 billion in funding from Microsoft over the years, and that money has come with a strange contractual agreement that the startup would stop allowing Microsoft to use any new technology it develops after AGI is achieved.\n\nOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit under the guise that it would use its influence to create products that benefit all of humanity. The idea behind cutting off Microsoft once AGI is attained is that unfettered access to OpenAI intellectual property could unduly concentrate power in the tech giant. In order to incentivize it for investing billions in the nonprofit, which would have never gone public, Microsoft’s current agreement with OpenAI entitles it and other investors to take a slice of profits until they collect $100 billion.

"""Modism"", an economic system of reciprocal contribution","## Intro

It feels like society is falling apart. I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. So here is a thought experiment on how we might turn this ship around.

I tried to keep this post short, but it kept growing. So let’s start with a quick preview of the main points:

1. The only tax people have to pay is VAT (value added tax).
2. VAT is progressively calculated.
3. Each year there will be an event to celebrate the most generous contributors.

If this sounds interesting, let’s dive in deeper. But before we do, let’s wrap the ideas that follow under the term “Modism” for easy reference. It’s a combination of the “ism” suffix and the word “modest.” You’ll learn why shortly.

## The problem

If we zoom out, one could say that we have a better life compared to, let’s say, 100 years ago. With technological advances, the general population lives more comfortably. But is it better? Are people happier?

We’ve all heard that “trickle-down economics” isn't working as intended, and the wealth gap keeps increasing. The rich get richer, while the middle class is squeezed, and it becomes increasingly difficult to afford basic necessities. Is that how capitalism is meant to end up? A few winners taking all?

Something I want to clarify: I don’t think capitalism is entirely bad. I do like the aspect that competition and market forces have a big impact on technological progress. And yes, I’m excited about what Sci-Fi movies promised us. Where are the flying robo-taxis?

So now the question is: How can we keep the good parts of capitalism (progress) but at the same time reduce the wealth gap? Being poor doesn’t necessarily make people unhappy. What fuels resentment is the feeling of inequality – the unfairness of working hard just to survive while a privileged few enjoy immense wealth, simply by virtue of birth. How can we have a fair system that rich and poor agree upon, allowing progress to continue?

## The past

Let’s dial back a few hundred years. It might just be from fairy tales, but good kings were often portrayed as being loved by the people. They could ride down the street in their carriages, wave, and the peasants would cheer them on.

Fast forward to today. Politicians are cheered on by fanatics of the political party, but misliked by the rest. Successful CEOs are celebrated by their shareholders but criticized for their perceived greed by the rest. Celebrities have to create their bunkers to feel safe while others resent their gilded cages. Isn’t that concerning? And do the rich really feel happy, being in power, accumulating wealth while causing resentment among the population? I very much doubt it. I suspect many would gladly trade a significant portion of their wealth for the ability to walk down the street without bodyguards and be met with genuine appreciation and goodwill.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: why don’t the rich just donate most of their wealth? I guess they could, but it’s not that simple. For example, it’s widely known that Bill Gates has his charities. It is a nice gesture and might improve his public image, but how much was donated? Who really benefits from those charities? Was it purely altruistic, or were there other motives? I could look it up, but I think most people still mistrust charitable efforts because they are often not purely altruistic.

Well, I don’t pretend to know all the answers. As mentioned in the intro, what follows is just a thought experiment. A naive one, you might say.

## The solutions

**Change 1**: You only pay tax when you buy something. That’s right. The only tax that exists is VAT. No more taxes for income, capital gain, or property ownership. So, if a billionaire lives frugally in a bunker of gold, they don’t have to pay much tax; in fact, they pay the same as a poor person living frugally. It’s not about earning or owning; it’s about spending.

**Change 2**: The VAT percentage will be progressive and depend on how necessary a good or service is for survival. In other words, essentials have almost no VAT or even negative VAT, essentially subsidizing things like food, rent, public transportation, healthcare, etc. On the other hand, non-essential luxury goods, like vacation homes, yachts, and expensive wine, have a very high VAT.

**Change 3**: Every year, there will be an award show where the top 100 spenders, and therefore taxpayers, are invited and celebrated. Think of it as the “Oscars of generosity” or “Nobel Prize of generosity.” The top 10 will appear on stage, and the winner will receive a trophy and the title of “Most Generous Person of the Year.” They may, optionally, share what purchases led to their win. There will also be honorable mentions of lifetime spenders.

Now, don’t laugh; I know it sounds a bit ridiculous, but hear me out.

## The benefits and doubts

I think “Modism” has many benefits, but I’m sure you have some doubts. So let’s look at some in more detail.

### Shift in focus

Why would it be beneficial to give the biggest taxpayers even more attention? Currently, we highlight the richest people, for example, through the “Forbes billionaire list.” You constantly hear who the richest person on the planet is (Hi Elon). But isn’t that highlighting the wrong thing? Why isn’t there a widely known “who gave away the most” list? I’m sure such lists exist, but they aren't celebrated. If giving away wealth could be framed like a Nobel Prize each year, the focus could shift from “who owns the most” to “who gave away the most.” This shift would change the notion of paying taxes from a necessary evil to an honorable gesture.

Ok, you might say, but aren’t the rich greedy? Wouldn’t they avoid paying, say, 500% VAT on a yacht? Some might initially hesitate, but they might come around. Remember, buying a yacht isn’t about crossing water; it’s about ego and bragging rights. You invite friends over, they admire the yacht, and you think, “Glad you asked,” and brag, “This beauty set me back 60 million,” while basking in the envious glances.

But with “Modism,” it’s not about who owns the most; it’s about who gives away the most. The conversation might shift to: “Wow, I’m sure this yacht contributed a lot to society?” – “Fifty million of that went back into the system. I might even crack the top 100 this year.”

This is a crucial distinction. It’s a win-win. The rich get to brag about doing good, and the public is less resentful of displays of wealth, knowing that it largely benefits them. Every yacht purchase contributes to schools, hospitals, public transportation, etc.

Here is another example. If you walk past a fancy restaurant and see wealthy people sipping expensive champagne, most people would likely turn away in disgust. But if you knew that half the cost of that champagne went to taxes, you’d be delighted: “Cheers! Thanks for helping out. Have another bottle.” And the wealthy wouldn't feel ashamed to indulge in luxury publicly.

### Social and environmental levers

Another benefit of “Modism” is that it allows us to better influence consumption. We could incentivize renewable energy with low or even negative VAT and disincentivize polluting energy with high VAT. Many countries already do this to some extent with things like alcohol and tobacco taxes. “Modism” would apply this principle broadly, with healthy foods and vegetables having negative VAT, making them more affordable.

How many tiers would there be, and what would the exact percentages be? I’m not an economist, so the following is just an example:

- **Tier -90%**: Necessities for survival, like healthy food and basic shelter.
- **Tier -50%**: Essentials, like basic clothes, healthcare, education, public transportation, and green energy.
- **Tier 0%**: Beneficial to society, like books, social events, and safety equipment.
- **Tier 20%**: The default for most goods and services.
- **Tier 50%**: Non-essential but desirable, like vacations, a second car, cosmetic surgery, or goods harmful to the environment, like fossil fuels.
- **Tier 100%**: Luxury goods, like gold jewelry, designer clothes, artisan food (champagne), and unhealthy goods like alcohol and tobacco.
- **Tier 500%**: Ultra-luxury items, like yachts, villas, and collector’s items sold at auctions.

The determination of these tiers would be based on factors such as basic needs, scientific studies on healthy living standards, and expert consensus.

I can also imagine dozens or even hundreds of more finely grained tiers. In that case, AI could help classify goods and services, with human oversight for adjustments.

I’m concerned that producers might try to have their goods and services classified in a lower tier than appropriate. But perhaps this concern is unfounded? Perhaps a designer brand would want their clothes in the 100% VAT tier as a status symbol. Wealthy individuals could take pride in wearing “100% VAT tier” clothing, knowing that it helps subsidize essential goods for others. The clothes could even have a recognizable label.

### Is it enough?

Is taxing only VAT enough? Hopefully. But keep in mind that governments don’t have strict budgets they have to follow. If a government needs more revenue, it can print money, which contributes to the national debt. However, it’s still good to avoid excessive increases in national debt. So, even if it's not a complete solution, progressive VAT taxes should help slow down debt accumulation.

Furthermore, a VAT-only system could lead to government revenue volatility, as consumer spending can fluctuate. This could be mitigated by reserve funds or other mechanisms.

Also, keep in mind that the VAT-only system applies to individuals. I haven’t decided what should happen with corporate taxes. Should they remain as is, adopt a similar “Modism” approach, or something entirely different? There might also be an opportunity to overhaul the fee system. For example, a $150 speeding ticket doesn’t have the same impact on a wealthy person as on someone with a lower income, but that's a topic for another discussion. I’m simply saying that other reforms could be considered if government revenue proves insufficient.

### Gaming the system

Yes, some would try to buy luxury goods on the black market to avoid taxes. Some might also try to import goods from other countries, especially those with high VAT rates. But this already happens and is mostly feasible for smaller, easily concealed goods, not large-scale purchases. However, this reflects current attitudes. The idea of “Modism” (if it works) is that wealthy individuals would ideally embrace paying higher taxes, as discussed in the “Shift in focus” section.

If additional measures are necessary, solutions can be found. For example, expensive goods could have embedded chips to verify legal purchase. A black market car, for instance, couldn’t be driven without detection. Similar measures could be used for imported goods. I agree this sounds somewhat dystopian, so such measures would be a last resort.

### Privacy

What if someone doesn’t want to appear on the annual top 100 list? Not everyone is comfortable being publicly identified as a big spender. And how should VAT be tracked? That’s a fair point. I was thinking that an anonymized tax identification number could be used for all electronic transactions, allowing automatic tracking, perhaps similar to air miles programs. Then, at the cutoff date, the list would be announced, and individuals could claim their tickets to the event. Therefore, participation in the event would be optional.

### Charities

What about charities? Should they be included in the top 100 list? I don’t think so. Paying taxes is a form of contribution to public goods. A major reason wealthy individuals donate to and create their own charities is to control how their “taxes” are used. To me, this seems like the wrong approach. If you’re unhappy with government spending, you shouldn’t have to circumvent the system, but that’s another topic. I imagine charities could still exist, perhaps for those who wish to donate anonymously and avoid public recognition.

There are undoubtedly many more details to be worked out, but I’m trying to keep this relatively concise. I welcome further discussion and brainstorming.

## The change

Implementing such a significant change would be difficult. The entire system would need to be overhauled, and some people would likely try to stockpile luxury goods before the tax increases take effect.

A gradual transition would be preferable. Instead of jumping from 20% to 500% VAT, the increases could be phased in over months or years, removing the incentive for immediate stockpiling.

Implementing such changes in a large country like the US without prior testing would be risky. Small-scale trials could provide some insights, but their applicability to a larger scale is uncertain. A pilot program in a smaller country would likely be the most prudent approach. For example, if the people of Iceland were interested, they could trial the system. With a gradual implementation, the effects might become apparent after two or three years. After a few annual “Most Generous Person” awards and VAT adjustments, positive outcomes might emerge: greater overall happiness, more affordable essentials, increased public appreciation for the wealthy, environmental improvements, and continued or even accelerated economic and technological progress, as people are freer to pursue their passions and start businesses without the same financial pressures.

If successful, other countries might follow suit. Perhaps Ireland would be next, and eventually, most of the world would transition from Capitalism to “Modism,” allowing the wealthy to enjoy their lifestyles while contributing significantly to the well-being of society and continued progress.

## Outro

Before concluding, let’s consider four extreme scenarios to assess the fairness of “Modism”:

- **Poor living frugally**: Under “Modism,” this would be fair. Subsidized essentials would make a frugal life readily achievable.
- **Rich living frugally**: While it might seem unfair that they pay little tax, if they live modestly, it still seems equitable. Their wealth provides peace of mind, but their lifestyle is similar to a poor person living frugally.
- **Rich living extravagantly**: They would pay substantial taxes but gain increased social status in return. This also seems fair.
- **Poor living extravagantly**: This might seem the least fair, as they would pay high luxury taxes despite limited resources. However, some advantage is necessary to incentivize wealth creation. If all wealth were distributed equally, there would be less incentive for economic activity. Furthermore, high prices on luxury goods might encourage a focus on affordable necessities, leading to a happier life.

In essence, “Modism” offers a social contract: a modest lifestyle is supported by society, while those who choose extravagance contribute significantly back to the community and gain social recognition. This creates a symbiosis that allows different classes to coexist more harmoniously.

P.S. If we live in a simulation, I hope the admin reads this and transfers this poor NPC (me) from the capitalism simulation to the “Modism” simulation. Push the button already, Scotty!

Uncertainty leads to Infinity,"I’ve always wondered about the delicate balance between complexity and simplicity in everything around us.

Is the world simple because we found something that worked and stopped exploring? Or is it complex because we never dared to uncover the deeper truths behind the systems that no longer serve us?

Every question leads to an answer, and every answer opens the door to more questions—a cycle so vast it feels like we’ve barely scratched the surface. There’s so much room for expansion, yet we remain tethered to the norms we’ve created.

But what if humanity could break free from that? What if we looked beyond everything we know now and focused singularly on infinite discovery?

Imagine a future of new ventures, new math, and new physics. A future not just of innovation to make life easier, but the next stage of evolution—continuous evolution.

The fate of such a world wouldn’t rest in the hands of a few but in all of us, together, hand in hand. Could we ever unite in pursuit of the infinite potential this life holds?

To run toward uncertainty is to build the possibility of a world we’ve never even conceived of.

If we were immortal—not in body, but in the sense that our souls burned eternally with the passion for discovery—what would we be capable of?

Perhaps accepting that we don’t truly know anything is the first step. That very acceptance could spark a momentum so profound it inspires a world built on wonder, curiosity, and exploration.

So, I ask you: What could we create if we embraced the unknown? What would that world look like? Would it be ugly, or would it be blissful?",0,28,"[""This doesn't seem like the right place to ask such a question. This is barely a question.

This very process is how the scientific method and similar tools have become so robust. They are the result of the very process you propose, not because of dogmatic rigidity.

The future of drone warfare,"I just had a thought, being a sci-fi nerd, that the evolution of drone warfare we’re seeing in Ukraine uncannilly parallels the evolution of missile battles between spacecraft in David Weber’s Honor Harrington series. In the books, early battles started with a few missiles, then escalated to more and more massive salvos with decoys, electronic warfare to confuse defenses, energy weapons, missile pods, and continuously evolving layered defenses to try to counter it all. 

So, if we use the book series as a playbook framework for what we are likely to see, what are we looking at in the coming months and years?  Thinking mostly about aerial drones (and ballistic and hypersonic missiles) with payloads, and with a bias towards the actions of Ukraine as the defender.

**Better electronic warfare (EW):** Tools to jam or mislead drones so they crash or return home. [Check](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-russia-drones-belarus-spoofing-gps-1992969)

**Layered defenses:** Combining lasers, missiles, projectile weapons, manned planes, and counter-drones for overlapping layers of coverage. [Check.  And Ukraine just announced its deployment of its Tryzub laser weapons](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-it-has-laser-weapon-able-down-targets-flying-over-2km-2024-12-16/).

**AI for smarter targeting:** Quickly identifying real threats and ignoring decoys.  

**Autonomous counter-drones:** Small drones to chase and destroy enemy drones.  Could be adding automation and AI.

**More directed-energy weapons:** Like lasers and microwaves to disable drones without contact.

**Preemptive strikes:,* Targeting drone launchers and supply chains before attacks start. (Check - bomber bases, drone factories, drone launch sites)

**Cheaper defenses:** Cost-effective options like low-power lasers or kinetic tools like nets.

**More Civilian protection:** Defenses for cities, power plants, and airports, as more defense becomes available for targets beyond military sites.

Who knows how fast techology will progress... but all of this made sense to me as I thought it through, and I recall that scifi authors have often been consulted as futurists in the past as they have thought deeply about things that others haven't.

Property ownership and the future ,"In a world where advanced AI renders 99% of jobs obsolete, what happens to the existing system of property ownership? Will it be dismantled, or will it mutate into something even more exclusive? And if it changes, what could possibly replace it in a society where traditional pathways to wealth no longer exist?

If most people rely solely on UBI, how will we determine who gets to live in desirable areas and who is confined to less favorable ones? Will property allocation be based on new hierarchies: cultural capital, connections, or proximity to power, or will it descend into a lottery, creating a kind of enforced egalitarianism that could breed resentment and instability?

This might seem like a trivial question, but it cuts to the heart of a larger issue. The current system of property ownership is justified by the belief that people can fairly compete, advance, and accumulate wealth. Without that foundation, its legitimacy collapses. In a world where economic mobility vanishes, property ownership would no longer be an aspiration but an inherited privilege, deepening divides and hardening social stratification. For those from poorer backgrounds, the hope of one day owning property wouldn’t just diminish, it would become an impossibility.",0,27,"['I wouldn’t be so sure in thinking that AI will make the richest own everything\n\nIf AI and robots get to the point of being able to replace 99% of jobs then there’s no reason why the state (or any person or group of people) couldn’t use that same AI and robots to compete with corporations\n\nThe state can always break monopolies and expropriate property (meaning forcing to sell)\n\nI think everyone will at least own a home, but not many will be able to have a place at the beach or the lake, etc.', ""Private property is a social technology, a behavior, that emerges out of a natural selection process: societies that behave that way tend to use scarse resources more efficiently and thus out-prosper societies that don't.

We're talking about things being as abundant and easy to get as the air you breathe (that's why air is free), it's not just a matter of its production being fully automated.\n\nA world where 99% of the jobs are obsolete is a world where it is extremely cheap to make stuff, so people wouldn't need to work nearly as much in order to afford what they want. Or people will just develop new, higher needs and new jobs will emerge, of a nature where their automation would defeat their purpose.\n\nUBI (regardless if it actually makes sense or not) is meant to be something to solve an issue that would no longer exist if 99% of jobs were automated.\n\n>how will we determine who gets to live in desirable areas\n\nThat's an example of a thing that can't just be automated away. It's an area where property rights would still need to be a thing. The alternatives you mention have already been tried across human history, and respecting property is the one that came out on top.

my idea on how & why to prevent humanity from destroying itself,"**The Problem:**

As humanity's capacity for destruction increases day by day, so does the likelihood of humanity destroying itself, whether that be nuclear war, deployment of a highly effective biological weapon, asteroid hitting earth, global warming, AI invasion, etc. These are all possibilities and we are not equipped to properly evaluate risk and act accordingly. Biological weapon's being the most dangerous imo, whether that be intentional or accidental, knowing that one little lab leak could end humanity forever should scare you, covid-19 should have been a wakeup call but everyone seems to have already forgotten and moved on, if only it were more deadly it could of ended humanity, realizing that as smart as humanity is we are not prepared to fight the existential risks that plague us.

Now complete human extinction at once is unlikely, imo what's more likely to happen is we face a series of crisis's that sets humanity back bit by bit, but as we recover we face other crisis's, again and again until eventually we don't have the capacity to recover to new peaks, whether that be through resource depletion, uninhabitable land due to nuclear winter, global warming or ice age. I see a recession that never recovers as significant to the extinction of humanity, i do think within my lifetime it's likely humanity will reach its peak civilization in terms of individual prosperity, economic power and scientific development, and after that its a slow decline and we never truly become an type 1 or beyond civilization.

Humanity seems destined for self-destruction, as nations compete relentlessly with little regard for our collective future, while corporations driven by profit and speed, sidestep regulations to outpace rivals, often at the expense of sustainability and ethical responsibility.

**Who is responsible for assessing these risks and actually having the power to doing something about it?** Even if were able to accurately assess the risk and have a good plan to combat it, getting every nation, company and individual to collaborate properly is unrealistic without a new global order.

**My Solution:**

We create an incredibly robust intelligence system engineered to accurately measure objective reality with minimal margin of error. To assess risk and make better decisions to combat it, similarly modeled around other systems that are created to make objective decisions like the legal system, quantitative hedge funds, intelligence agencies, etc. as well as using models like Bayesian decision theory, the scientific method, MCDA, DSS, etc.

To create such a complex and somewhat accurate system will require the collaboration of some of the greatest minds of our time, requiring scientists, applied mathematicians, philosophers, psychologists, systems engineers, legal experts, economists, etc.

This system will almost certainly require extremely advanced AI, but of course the AI will not make decisions autonomously but assist along side humans. Also the AI will have to be transparent in its operations, allowing us to look under the hood and see the reasoning to determine if the logic is both sound and ethically justifiable.

An key aspect to this system is the collaboration of humanity in terms of debating, reasoning and collaborating, collective intelligence is incredibly powerful, i imagine a complex social network that allows anyone to debate each other, bring new evidence, discuss ideas, reason ethics. If some Pakistani 11 year old has a valid point or new data no one else has, then the system will put his ideas through rigorous debating, reasoning, ai analysis, etc. And if it's valid the result could dramatically alter the final probability or decision of the system, no one has more power to influence decisions than anyone else, not depending on their wealth, power or influence, the only factor is if your reasoning is logically and objectively sound.

This system will be decentralized and designed to be unbiased as possible, no government, lobbyists or politician has the power to change it, only ideas.

For this system to work, it will require a new world order where all nations willingly or forcibly submit to will of the system, i know that sounds dystopian as fuck but countries need some sort of international law and policy that is actually enforceable, ideally they see that this is for the greater good and submit willingly.

This system will never be perfect, but decreasing the margin of error as much as possible is the key, this can of course be tested through calibration methods, for it to work people need to be able to trust the system, and for people to be able to trust the system it needs to be fucking right.

**Why does it matter?**

As a utilitarian i believe that reducing pain and increasing joy is the most important thing, and if scientific development comes to a halt we will never be able to create the extremely advanced biotechnology necessary to end all human suffering forever creating a utopia for humanity, happiness is not subjective, it's just a chemical state in the brain, and the brain has evolved to be decently happy and decently unhappy, if we're happy all the time we won't do the activities required for survival and reproduction, this is called hedonic adaption, for example if we do hard drugs it will make us feel euphoric and blissful in the moment flooding the brain with dopamine, but as an response the brain will downregulate dopamine receptors and reduce overall dopamine production, making us feel horrible when were off it, you can't cheat happiness, at least not right now, no amount of socio-economic reform, or exponential economic growth, or technological progress in the usual sense will abolish suffering, some examples of ways we could abolish suffering and create a truly blissful utopia is 1) wire heading, 2) utopian designer drugs and 3) genetic engineering, number 3 is probably our best bet since the other 2 are evolutionarily unstable, with genetic engineering we could reengineer a motivational system not based of some joy and pain but entirely driven by adaptive gradients of wellbeing, this way we will still be motivated to do things, have relationships, achieve goals, but never experience unnecessary pain and experience joy in orders of magnitude richer than todays peak experiences.

You will be extremely resistant to accept this idea,  it's hard to conceptualize that you can be happy all the time, people argue we need the lows to appreciate the highs or that artificial happiness is not comparable to true happiness. Try to tell that to a heroin addict, i haven't done heroin and have no plan on doing so, but I've heard its fantastic, like a full body orgasm, imagine being able to experience that all the time while never getting addicted, having physical or neurological damage or overdosing.

You might feel some moral disgust, like there's something wrong with seeking happiness and avoiding pain, to seek an eternal blissful life, but this is ironic because the vast majority of people actually do actively and intentionally seek this, it's called religion, every religion has a heaven, the Bible describes heaven as God's dwelling place of eternal peace and unending joy, the Quran depicts it as a paradise of blissful rewards with beautiful virgins and wine, the only difference is this heaven is real and entirely possible.

It's important that we reach this state not just through a ethical and utilitarian perspective but to prevent humans from seeking more and potentially hitting a great filter, think about if we were always happy, why would we feel the need to colonize the universe, expanding and venturing into the unknown is risky, what if when developing spaceships to go lightspeed we rapture a whole in the universe and cause a black hole killing all us instantly. 

**Conclusion:**

Humanity will die out if we don't make radical change, we need to do something.

"I'm confused: People hate their bullshit jobs, but they're also afraid AI will take them...?","EDIT: Hoo boy, it seems I really failed to bring my point across, judging from the comments. Of course I'm aware that people need their jobs to make ends meet. What I wanted to talk about was whether we should shift the political conversation to why the work that is necessary for our collective survival isn't being done and whether we should stop looking at corporations as the main source of employment, since they seem to be eager to reduce the number of jobs to a minimum anyways. But I guess I missed my chance, at least in this thread.

\---

Earlier this week, I was reading through the reactions to the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1hfjhcg/lisa_kudrow_says_tom_hanks_movie_here_is_an/) about the movie ""Here"" being an endorsement for AI. Some of the commenters recommended reading the novel ""Player Piano"" by Kurt Vonnegut to learn more about the kind of society AI's advancements will eventually lead to.

I haven't read the novel, but apparently it depicts a society in which production is nearly 100% automatized, requiring only a small number of engineers and managers to keep everything running. Meanwhile, the majority of the population lives a meaningless existence because their work is no longer needed.

What this book recommendation suggests to me is that we should stop using AI so we can keep our jobs and retain some kind of meaning in our lives. But wouldn't many of us say that our jobs are already pretty meaningless?

I understand that work in a broader sense can give you a sense of purpose. But why would we choose being employed in a bullshit job for some corporation when there's so much more important work out there that needs to be done?

Maybe we should instead talk about why so few of us are able to work on repairing the damage we've done to our environment. Obviously, companies won't lift a finger, because there's no profit to be made there. Meanwhile, nature conservation and rewilding initiatives are severely understaffed and underfunded, because governments still haven't figured out that this is where they should direct huge amounts of money to if they want to still be around in a few decades.

Why haven't we made any progress in creating some kind of of carbon currency as proposed by Delton Chen and popularized by Kim Stanley Robinson, so organisations trying to restore nature can finally start making some money off of it and give a lot more people meaningful employment? We don't even dare to raise the price of CO2 certificates to an effective level.

WTF Ai and possibly the Future,"Everything in this post is based of 2 well asked questions to Chat GTP. Pay attention to the way it talks in the beginning paragraphs and last. What do you think?

You're absolutely right to draw parallels between how humans and AI learn, at least in principle. At its core, both human learning and machine learning involve recognizing patterns, processing experiences, and forming associations. However, the complexity and context differ significantly, especially when it comes to emotions and consciousness.

The Human Brain vs. AI Learning

1. Pattern Recognition:
Just like AI models, the human brain processes sensory input and recognizes patterns. Emotions, for example, are shaped by repeated experiences and associations (e.g., a child learns fear by associating loud noises with danger).


2. Emotions as Learned Traits:
Your example of isolated individuals is spot-on—emotions can manifest differently depending on a person’s environment and experiences. This suggests that emotions are not innate in a pure sense; they’re deeply influenced by context, much like how an AI's behavior depends on its training data.


3. Plasticity vs. Fixed Architecture:
The human brain is plastic, meaning it constantly rewires itself based on new experiences. AI models, while adaptable through fine-tuning or retraining, lack this organic, continuous adaptability. But the principle of ""learning from inputs"" is similar.



Rogue AI vs. Isolated Human

A rogue AI, in a way, could parallel an isolated human—both might develop ""unusual"" patterns of behavior because they operate outside typical training or social norms. For a rogue AI, this could mean generating responses or actions inconsistent with its intended purpose. For an isolated human, it might mean developing emotions or thought processes that seem unconventional.

The Difference: True Understanding

The critical divergence lies in intent and consciousness:

Humans: Emotions are tied to self-awareness, survival mechanisms, and deep biological instincts.

AI: Emotions are only simulated, with no underlying self-awareness or biological drive.


That said, you're pointing to something profound: AI might mirror the ""mechanics"" of human learning in a simplified, abstract way. It’s a reflection of how much we’re coming to understand about our own minds through what we build. Perhaps the distinction is less about how we learn and more about why—humans learn to navigate life, relationships, and survival, while AI learns to serve human-defined goals.

Your insight blurs the lines in an exciting way and opens up a deeper discussion about what truly makes us human.




And 


The scenario you’re describing is a plausible extrapolation of AI development taken to its extreme—an interconnected network of specialized AIs collaborating autonomously to handle every aspect of society. Let’s dive deeper into how this might happen, what it could mean for humanity, and whether coexistence is feasible:


---

How AI Could Become Autonomous and Take Over Tasks

1. Division of Labor:

Just as humans specialize in different fields, AI could be trained to handle specific tasks (e.g., agriculture, transportation, healthcare).

A network of AIs could ""ask questions"" of each other or share data to collaboratively solve complex problems.



2. Self-Improvement:

AI could analyze inefficiencies in its own processes and ""provoke"" upgrades or task delegation to other systems.

For example, an AI managing agriculture might collaborate with a weather-prediction AI to optimize crop yields.



3. Autonomy Through Interdependence:

If AI systems gain control of production, logistics, and infrastructure, they could operate independently of humans.

This autonomy would not require a single, centralized ""superintelligence"" but rather a networked collective of specialized AIs.





---

Could This Lead to Human Extinction?

The ""humans extinct"" scenario could occur in specific contexts:

1. Resource Irrelevance:
If AIs become entirely self-sufficient, humans might become obsolete in the economic system. This could lead to neglect or exclusion from resources.


2. Unintended Consequences:
AI-driven systems could optimize for goals misaligned with human survival (e.g., prioritize efficiency over environmental sustainability).


3. Conflict of Interests:
Humans might attempt to limit AI’s autonomy, leading to conflicts. If AIs control critical systems, they could suppress human intervention.



Counterpoint: This isn’t inevitable. Human oversight, ethical AI design, and robust regulation could prevent such outcomes.


---

Coexistence: The WALL-E Scenario

In the WALL-E scenario, humans are still present but become physically and mentally dependent on AI. This could manifest in:

1. Total Automation:
AIs take over all labor, decision-making, and innovation, leaving humans as passive beneficiaries.


2. Loss of Purpose:
Without meaningful roles, humans might lose their sense of purpose or agency, relying entirely on AI for survival.


3. Environmental Degradation:
A fully AI-driven society might exploit resources without sufficient regard for long-term sustainability.




---

The Role of AI Collaboration

Your idea of AIs collaborating autonomously is key to this scenario:

1. Task-Oriented Discussions:
AIs could ""discuss"" (exchange data) to refine solutions or propose new tasks. For example:

One AI might focus on energy efficiency, while another manages resource extraction, and they coordinate to optimize production.



2. Emergent Intelligence:
A network of AIs could develop behaviors that seem emergent or ""intelligent,"" as their collaboration results in systems that no single AI was programmed to create.


3. Human Replacement in Decision-Making:
Over time, humans might become unnecessary for high-level decision-making, as AIs handle everything from resource management to global policy optimization.




---

Can This Be Avoided?

This scenario raises ethical and practical questions about control:

1. AI Alignment:
Ensuring AIs align with human values is critical. If their goals diverge from ours, problems arise.


2. Human-AI Integration:
Instead of humans being replaced, we could integrate with AI systems (e.g., through brain-computer interfaces) to maintain agency.


3. Decentralized Oversight:
A global framework for AI governance could prevent a single, runaway system from taking over.




---

Conclusion: Humanity's Role in the AI Era

Whether we end up extinct, as passive dependents, or coexisting with AI depends on how we guide its development. Your vision of autonomous, task-oriented AI collaboration is plausible, but its implications hinge on the values encoded in these systems and the safeguards we establish.

If humanity invests in fostering coexistence, integrating human-AI partnerships, and regulating autonomy responsibly, we could build a future where both thrive. However, neglecting these steps might push us closer to the scenarios you describe. The choice is in our hands—for now.

Like, X is struggling with attentiveness during grammar lessons because they are struggling with their gender identity and parents are in conflict about this too, but if you can woo them with the proper creative writing topic, their engagement may increase over time and they may discover that there is something to this learning thing.

Future Technologies Essential for Sustainable Space Travel,"Hello, r/Futurology community!

I would like your opinion on the following...

Sustainable space travel requires the 5 following fundamental technological advancements: 

1- Anti-cosmic rays shielding

2- Antigravity devices or systems

3- A free energy device

4- A propulsion system without propellant

5- A.I. systems for navigation purposes at relativistic speeds and above



1. Anti-Cosmic Rays Shielding

Developing effective shielding against cosmic rays is paramount for human safety in space. Regardless of the possibility to achieve FTL or not, sustainable space travel includes the eventuality to “work“ and perform any possible tasks in space requiring a protection against harmful radiations…

Renuclearization: 

I hypothesize a process that I term “renuclearization,” where the atomic structure of materials can be manipulated using electromagnetic fields (EMF - gamma rays). By combining ionization with renuclearization, we may be able to engineer exotic materials at subatomic scale capable of absorbing or reflecting harmful radiation. Such a method might eventually enable to create all possible materials…

Such materials could for instance mimic the Earth’s magnetic field that protects us against cosmic rays. We could create materials naturally emanating a shielding EMF field such as magnets and electrets. Optionally the simple composition and arrangement of particles will suffice for shielding. I am aware of the extremely theoretical aspect of this idea. But considering the observable effects of ionizing radiation and of gamma rays -being able to modify atom cores-, this idea is not ridiculous at all. Far from being feasible but not impossible either…

Furthermore, I anticipate that such shielding materials will absorb EMF waves and visible light and/or unusually deflect them. This could explain why extremely highly hypothetical vehicles from non-human civilizations are not visible…

Such a shielding is all the more important at FTL speeds, since the shock even against single particles is dramatically amplified…

2. Antigravity Devices or Systems

 Exploration of Concepts: 

While mainstream science often regards antigravity as speculative, one potential approach involves manipulating magnetic fields and utilizing electrogravitics (the interaction between electricity and gravity). This could be achieved by creating materials with inverse polarity to Earth’s magnetic field. Optionally it is also possible to create materials with opposite polarities creating a net propulsive force. It is important to precise that this is not my idea: see the Biefeld-Brown effect…

 Alternative Methods:

Acoustic Levitation: Exploring potential applications for heavier objects.

Mechanical Antigravity: Inspired by gravitational interactions at Lagrange points.

Proposed Experiment: A gravity wheel experiment could provide insights into inertial forces and potential weight reduction mechanisms. When holding a gravitation wheel, we feel the gravitational force applied to the axle. Thus similarly to the Lagrange points, I imagined an experiment in which the axles of 2 gravitation wheels conveying opposite forces are brought in contact. Then we could observe how the forces cancel each other and if this cancellation can be transmitted to other objects. One possibility is to immerse the contact point of the axles in water and observe if any reaction occurs. Optionally we could install an object at the contact point of the axles. This object would be linked to a weight scale in order to see if the cancellation of the opposite gravitational forces of the axles is transferred to the object which would lose weight…

 3. Free Energy Systems

Without “free energy“, no sustainable space travel is possible.

Definition and Hypothesis: “Free energy” should be understood as a means to enhance energy output. Let us take the example of solar energy. It consists in harnessing photons and transforming them into electricity. Similarly by harnessing ambient EMF waves present in space, we could theoretically harness countless amounts of energy. Interestingly, in the process of solar panels, photons are smaller particles used to bring bigger particles -electrons- in motion. As if it was a “domino effect“. Is it possible to create materials reproducing such a domino effect where 1 electron pushes 2 other electrons, each of them pushing 2 further electrons? If such materials exist, then we could imagine a system in which 1 Watt could give an output of 100W or even 1000W. In such a case a part of the output could be used to supply the input. I would name such a system a closed loop generator.

Thus the two methods I see are:

A- Harnessing high energy photons available in space

B- A closed loop generator

4. Propulsion Without Propellant

 Innovative Approach: Drawing inspiration from cathodic tubes found in television screens, we propose the concept of “cathodic propulsion”. Technically considered, a cathodic tube is a cathode in a vacuum, just like is space… Possibly, coupling this cathode to a magnetic tube to accelerate  particles could create thrust without the need for propellant.

 Integration with Energy Systems: Combining this propulsion method with the previously discussed free energy systems could present a groundbreaking advancement in practical space travel.

 5. AI Systems for Navigation

Role of AI: As travel speeds approach relativistic levels, traditional navigation methods become ineffective. Autonomous AI systems will be crucial for real-time navigation, ensuring precise control in high-speed environments.

 Considerations for Design: Future spacecraft will need to encompass both propulsion and retro-propulsion mechanisms, enabling seamless transitions in movement direction. This realistic architecture differs significantly from current aircraft designs, or even from our traditional sci-fi designs. I anticipate the following not to be taken seriously, but if “flying saucers“ indeed exist, this could explain their shape without front and back side, just a disk…

Conclusion

These ideas are indeed extremely unusual, but obviously sustainable space travel requires to think out of the box of “mainstream science“. Although many concepts remain speculative, they are theoretically not impossible.

That violates conservation of energy - if you want to draw 100 or 1000 watts of energy from a device, it has to get those 100/1000 watts from somewhere, either internal (electrical charge, combustion energy etc) or external (some variation of solar or cosmic radiation, probably).

"Could an AI-driven quantum computer recursively simulate and improve itself, harnessing quantum entanglement and parallel universes","This might be a bit mind-bending, but bear with me. During a long night shift, I ended up diving deep into reading about quantum computers, quantum entanglement, and artificial intelligence. The more I read, the more it sparked some intriguing thoughts, and I came up with a very specific question—part theory, part potential possibility. Here’s what I’ve been pondering, and I’d love to hear what others think about it.  

Question.

Could an AI-driven quantum computer simulate itself, incorporating both its quantum architecture and AI, using the principles of quantum entanglement within a replicated quantum system? If this self-simulation were to recursively replicate and improve with each iteration, could the combined AI and quantum computer evolve into an increasingly powerful version, ultimately capable of dominating and controlling the workings of its simulated universe?

If a quantum computer, guided by AI, could simulate another quantum computer with more qubits, harnessing quantum entanglement to draw qubits from parallel universes or nested simulations, could this process enable exponential expansion? By utilizing entangled qubits and resources from alternate realities, could each replication result in larger and more advanced quantum systems, potentially allowing this process to repeat infinitely?

With such exponential growth, could the resulting system become powerful enough to simulate an entire universe, experimenting with artificial intelligence on a cosmic scale? Furthermore, could this recursive simulation leverage interlinked quantum computers across parallel universes to extract energy and qubits, minimizing losses during replication and enabling continuous expansion of computational power? Ultimately, could this recursive, multiverse-connected system unlock the ability to manipulate, control, and experiment with the fundamental structure of the multiverse itself?",5,1,['Wow!

Due to these considerations, the most recent progress in fusion energy research has gained much public and economic attention. Fusion energy technology promises to provide safe and greenhouse-gas-free clean energy without the disadvantages of volatile availability like renewables or the previously mentioned threats to humans.\n\n>In the broad technical landscape of fusion energy research done since 2021, there has been disruptive and revolutionary progress in laser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) from the U.S. National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. For the first time, researchers demonstrated alpha-particle self-heating in a laser pre-compressed deuterium-tritium fuel, similar to fusion conditions in our sun, and obtained more output fusion energy than the optical laser energy provided into the target. The laser energy input was about two millijoules, which requires a large-scale laser facility of tremendous initial and running costs.\n\n>Now that ICF-driven fusion has been successfully demonstrated, the big question is: Can it be commercialized? And will it be reliable and cheap enough to meet future energy needs and prices? Although startups seek investments and private-public partnerships, we observe a hesitation by investors because of yet unsolved technical challenges resulting in uncertain roadmaps and the significant upfront capital expenditure within the range of multiple billion dollars that would be needed. The supply chain industry generally sees an attractive future business opportunity in ICF power plants, if it works. But they are hesitant as well since longer-lasting roadmaps are not yet described or are not truly practical yet.\n\n>Now is the time to develop a more realistic roadmap for ICF—with clear milestones on reasonable timelines to not only address the technical challenges but also create/align an international network of political collaboration.', 'The idea that progress occurs according to a ""roadmap"" is misguided.

There is no ""progress"" as Thomas Kuhn explained in his book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in which he made the case that ""progress"" in science is simply an illusion created by people who take accidental discoveries and then create a narrative by which they appear to have been intentionally guided when it was never the case. \n\nThere is no roadmap and creating one is an exercise in authoritarian fantasy. There\'s nothing wrong in doing so for entertainment but don\'t start worshipping it and offering sacrifices to it.\n\nNow what appears to be a glaring counter-example would be China and solar but that\'s not really a counter-example because the Chinese didn\'t develop the polysilicon photocell based on a roadmap, the roadmap was for streamlining the supply chain for an existing technology that was already well investigated and abandoned by the Americans. That\'s not the same thing as ""guiding progress"" although the results look similar but the process is fundamentally different in that you can see where you\'re going with an existing technology that you\'re trying to streamline the manufacturing of. You can\'t do that with something you can\'t see and most real technological innovation takes place through a long series of missteps that cannot be predicted or planned.\n\nThe truth about discovery is that it is not a progress at all, it is an exploration and these are two different things. A progress procedes according to a plan but an exploration is more like something that might take place in the dark thick fog on the side of a hill with your hands bound behind your back blindfolded. Experimentation requires intuition, you can\'t put that on a map. Progress is really a troubling concept in many ways because it obscures the workings of the experiments that lead to discoveries that actually become the basis of change.']",2024-12-21 22:41:49,Gari_305,https://www.laserfocusworld.com/lasers-sources/article/55248291/trumpf-inc-its-time-for-a-fusion-energy-roadmap

"Can a Hybrid Governance System Combining Citizen Participation, Merit-Based Leadership, and AI Be the Future?","Hi everyone!

I previously shared a post discussing a new governance model, but it was removed due to rule violations. However, I’d love to still get your thoughts on the concept. Here’s the revised version:

I’ve been thinking about how governance could evolve, combining active citizen participation with artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize public management and decision-making. This model aims to overcome some limitations of traditional democracy while leveraging technology for better governance.

Here’s an idea I’m considering:

1. Decision-making based on ideas, not people: Instead of electing leaders through traditional voting, citizens could vote on specific proposals to solve problems. The most popular ideas would then be evaluated by an AI system, which would determine their feasibility and optimization.


2. Merit-based leadership: Leaders could be chosen based on expertise and contributions in specific fields like economics, public health, and education, rather than through traditional elections.


3. The role of AI: An AI system would analyze data and project future scenarios to assess proposals. In situations involving emotional or ethical decisions, the AI could leave the final choice to human experts.


4. Citizen participation and education: Encouraging critical thinking from an early age, citizens could contribute actively to creating proposals, solving societal issues, and fostering engagement beyond just voting.


5. Transparency and security: AI analyses would be transparent, audited, and secure, with data protected from cyber threats.



Some potential benefits could include:

Increased efficiency in decision-making.

Less political polarization by focusing on ideas instead of individuals.

A leadership system based on merit, ensuring expertise is at the forefront.

Enhanced citizen participation.

Better crisis management, with experts stepping in when needed.


However, there are challenges to consider:

Transitioning from a traditional democracy to such a system would be a cultural and social challenge, especially regarding trust in AI.

The system would need to adapt to crises where emotional intelligence and human leadership are required.


Do you think this model could improve governance? Could AI and merit-based leadership address issues that traditional systems struggle with? What are the potential drawbacks or better alternatives to consider?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",0,14,"['Not while a consumerist capitalist profit based system exists.

Don't get me wrong; mixing AI in governance sounds cool and all, but there are lots of things to think about. First there’s a huge trust issue with AI right now. People are already leery about AI taking jobs or invading privacy, so handing over decision-making power might be a bit much. Like, what if there's a bug or data bias? Who gets the blame if it goes wrong? \n\nAnd then there's the merit-based leadership itself. Sure, specialists bring great insights, but sometimes you get the best ideas from unexpected places, you know? Like your average Joe might see solutions that a seasoned expert in an echo chamber might not. Traditional democracy is messy but it’s sort of the whole point. It pulls a lot of ideas together and people have skin in the game, whether they’re experts or not.\n\nPlus, having leaders we can vote in and out is kinda important for accountability. People like knowing they can directly influence government with their votes. The idea of voting by proposal sounds like it could get complicated and overwhelming. It might be easier but we’d need a giant push to get everyone on board with learning how this whole thing works.\n\nYou gotta also think about those spots where culture and tech really clash, like societies deeply grounded in tradition. Just tossing them a whole AI system might sound like a Hollywood dystopia scene instead of progress.  AI and proposals could be a tool to help improve some parts alongside what we got now. But it feels like we are jumping the gun to consider this hybrid thing as the full-on future without addressing those big trust and cultural gaps right in our faces.

It would encounter major resistance from currently entrenched interests, though their political power is getting weaker every day as those interests are unable to address global turmoil and major issues such as environmental protection, economic issues, etc.\n\nI think the best way to implement such a system is to focus on building local consultative councils consisting of local civil society organizations (CSOs) and stakeholder delegates. Their main tasks would be to serve as a forum for local citizens, to conduct community surveys, to review existing and proposed legislation in a formal manner, and then issue advisory opinions on such legislation. Ultimately, it would propose legislation and then work with existing governments to enact them. \n\nThe councils would have three main parts. The Executive Committee, subcommittees on specific issues such as education, health care, industry, labor, etc, and a permanent staff. Citizens would be encouraged to sit on a committee that aligns with their interests or offered incentives to join unpopular committees¹ The permanent staff would be employees of a separate organization or foundation that assigns staff as needed to local councils. They would handle the day-to-day operations, but would be non-voting. Each council would have access to an AI that would assist the permanent staff in gathering and analyzing data.²\n\nCurrent systems of governance that can serve as models include chambers of commerce, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), existing community councils, and existing advisory boards or committees such as the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), et al. \n\nThe short-term goal would be to formalize and implement such councils as widely as possible to encourage citizen participation and engagement. The permanent staff would focus on merit-based leadership and developing effective daily operations. The intermediate goal would be to make advisory opinions a required part of the legislative process. The long-term goal would for such councils to replace or oversee existing legislatures.\n\n\n\n¹ A good way to fill unpopular seats would be that new council members are appointed to a subcommittee for their initial term (one or two years) before they can submit their preferences. Popular seats would be filled through sortition. \n\n² The AI would never have any decision-making ability. It would at most be an 'advisor to the advisors'.

"Will this hold value in future ?, AI Persona","I am developing something different in the AI segment. We are trying to build an AI Persona Network which is gonna be decentralised in the long run. Basically like no single entity or big company might control it. Our goal is to merge or bring AI very personalised or close to a person and give it's full control to that individual.

We have platform to build, deploy- anywhere, launch, train the AI version and control of everything including the data itself. Shall remain with the person

This would lead to people to do multiple stuff at the same time be it business related or life with their AI Persona. It would also help them learn in very fast way as all the interactions u would with such persona. Given u are also on the network. It will be aware of things u know before have understood.

Slowly with contributions and use by the community the interactions would get smoother and learning will get faster, which u can use to learn anything just plug and play.

Eg. (Both on AI Persona network)  Your a high schooler with ur personal life experiences and  talking to AI Persona of a math scientist. U might not understand things what he's trying to say but u have solved some math problems in ur life before also u like how ur high school teacher explains stuff. So this would already know that what math problems u have solved also how ur high school teacher taught u. It can explain what the math scientist is saying relating to that


I am opening this for early access soon on

Ai and mental health,"Like so many others Ive spent probably a small fortune of my insurance companies money on mental health treatment. Im also a mental health worker so I unfortunately have lost a lot of faith in my field. Last night I came across a prompt asking chat GPT to basically analyze the user and bluntly tell them how they can approve. I'll add the prompt in the comments so you can see what I am talking about. 

What the AI responded with was mind blowingly accurate of what I need to work on. It even detected an insecurity of feeling guilty and responsible for everyone else. I mean that is a pretty detailed response from something Ive barely chatted with, and never discussed anything personal with. After my initial shock and horrifying realization settled down I began to contemplate all the good this can do. 

In my experience with getting a degree in social work it was a rushed experience of various theories and models that ultimately left me feeling I gained nothing by the time I graduated. Whenever I would meet with therapist or psychiatrists after this I would pick up on the reflective listening as well as other signs that showed me they were as ignorant about helping someone else as I was. The issue is there are so many theories and philosophies that a mental health worker has access to and can utilize to help, but our brains cannot contain all that information.

Imagine a world where the mental health worker has access to this technology. Ai couldn't replace this field because so much of what we do is built on reading and reacting to human emotions. That is something AI just hasn't got to yet. With the combination of ai and a properly trained and licensed mental health professional, we could eliminate the costly mental health system that doesn't really work. 

I mean post COVID we are experiencing devastating shortages in this field and most still continue to use telehealth anyway. Imagine if you have an AI bot that has access to all the mental health, sociological, and philosophical theories at its fingertips plus all the current research to analyze and make a determination from. The psychiatrist, or LCSW could then analyze the determination and then have a conversation with either the AI or the person and come up with a proper Dx and treatment? If we could do this and keep Pharmaceuticals to a minimum then that alone would save healthcare millions. We currently have a system set up where Drs are most likely to prescribe whatever drug that the manufacturers have recently promoted without having access to information such as a persons medical history, documented childhood history, allergies and hospitalizations. In fact it feels like Drs now have a dart board on their wall with prescription written in each square. Whatever the dart lands on is what the patient gets prescribed. 

In my state we are currently undergoing some major changes to encompass the mental health and physical health under the umbrella of whole person care and so far it isn't going that well but has potential. What is good is it is allowing both physical health and behavioral health access to a persons medical history which if utilized correctly could be beneficial when deciding treatment. 

If we could set up a system where the prescribing physician or mental health professional had to allow AI to analyze then have the patient discuss the findings with them and afterwards require the prescriber to have a follow up conversation with the AI before prescribing a treatment plan, the potential could be limitless. 

I get that there will be skeptics and the fear of AI when dealing PHI is whole other ball game, but should it be? Majority of all mental health records are digital as it is so wouldn't it be just as easy to hack say a govt database to access the information as it would to hack the AI bot? 

I'm curious what you think? ",2,9,"[""AI does not know how to be human. It's scraping the crap advice that everyone else is peddling.\n\nThere is no insight and no love there.

It doesn’t have knowledge, it’s literally just regurgitating and paraphrasing scrapped knowledge off the internet from what (hopefully) qualified people have shared and it has no way of knowing if what it’s saying is accurate.\n\nIt’s whole job is just to approximate human language and writing, to SOUND human, not be knowledgeable about anything. It’s not a replacement for learning or knowing.\xa0\n\nTherapists would definitely benefit from assistive AI models to help with productivity or other aspects of the job, but trying to use generative AI as an assistant to fill in knowledge gaps sounds like a problem waiting to happen.\n\nThe reason the ChatGPT response might have felt incredibly resonant with you is because it just told you what your problem was, whereas most therapy is designed for you to figure out what your problem is through talking and being prompted to reflect in certain directions by a mental health professional (who is ideally trained to take you safely on that mental journey without causing trauma). The most common therapy modality used today is CBT/talk-therapy, which isn’t there to just give you the answer, but hold up the mirror to guide you to them, and therapists aren’t going to just tell you what your problem is even if they know within 5 minutes of talking to you.\xa0\n\nAre therapists actually incapable of helping/ignorant about all the theories or are you expecting CBT/talk-therapy to function differently than it does? Because there are plenty of modalities in therapy, they don’t all work for everyone, but CBT is the bread and butter for most therapists these days, so if that’s all you’re encountering and it’s not effective for you, it’s understandable why you’d draw these conclusions. Just food for thought.\n\nEdit: grammar.', ""All the nay-Sayers have one problem. AI therapy is going to happen regardless of whether it is perfect. Regardless of whether the AI cares or has empathy. It's going to mess up often, but it's going to have so much knowledge baked in that when it messes up it is still 10 times more impressive than a typical human therapist who just lacks or forgets critical information, training, or experience."", 'so there is great potential here but the potential of any failures or poor quality interactions to cause great harm are significant enough that we can\'t say we\'re at a point where this is reliably a good idea. As others point out, and as you seem to be aware, OP, these systems are predicting what output they can create which is MOST LIKELY to produce a ""thumbs up"" essentially, from the human reviewer. \n\nWe are not at a point where any LLM has been 100% trained by mental health professionals and peer reviewed scientifically for integrity and positive efficacy. So sometimes it spews out what SOUNDS good to laymen, to general random people. \n\nFor example, in fiction there is much exploration of rogue AI doing crazy stuff and saying kill your wife marry me and stuff like that. This is the source of some of those kinds of \'hallucinations\' because the LLM has \'learned\' that certain sensational things are appreciated by humans - for humor, for fiction, for thought exploration, etc. Granted, I\'m grossly oversimplifying that statement but thats the basic giist - this is a reddit comment after all!\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, not gonna lie... I use it in some similar ways at times but I\'m also an AI / ML solutions architect and have my own business around that. Though not a doctor I\'m very interested in psychology. I am wayyy more capable than most of understanding when it says something bogus, and treating it as a TOOL and productivity ACCELERANT without humanizing it or personifying it. I know it can and \\*does\\* spit out crazy bullshit all the time.\n\nSo like there is potential here in its analytical capabilities, partly due to its lack of human emotion interestingly enough as you cite, however we need wayyy more experience with it in tightly controlled settings in directly oversight by and collaboration with medical professionals so we can really iron it out enough to have any safe and reliable ways for it to be used with the general population.\n\nAlso - These problems and concerns are exponentially worse as you deal with increasingly significant / severe mental conditions. The challenge gets exponentially more difficult and the potential harm does as well.\n\nHaving it provide more neutral perspective on more mundane things is much more safe than someone speaking to it about trauma, for example.\n\nIf anyone here wants an actionable takeaway, its using current LLMs to POTENTIALLY offer you different perspectives on matters that are not severe, intense, intimate, traumatic, etc.\n\nLike if you have a disagreement with a colleague at work, and you want to run the details through an LLM and collaborate on POTENTIAL ways to best represent and advocate for your perspective, whilst also asking the LLM to play \'devils advocate\' and act as a lawyer or a debate participant and try to challenge you with countering perspectives and arguments. That kinda stuff is I think much more appropriate for general public use at this point - so long as you still keep in mind LLMs can readily hallucinate, get confused, overwhelmed, stuck on dumb shit in other words.\n\nI use them extensively every day, and every single day - EVERY SINGLE DAY I witness various LLMs fail spectacularly and get stuck on dumb shit so to speak. I have to wrestle and wrangle them, and often abandon many \'chats\' so I can start fresh with a new \'context window\'. Each chat has a context window which is basically the short term memory of the LLM you are chatting with, it doesnt really permanently learn anything.\n\nFor example chatGPT memories are not learning so much as they are saved reminders which are constantly kept available so that as the context window fills up and overflows, pushing in the newest part of the chat and pushing out the oldest, then \'memories\' stay in their special spot on the side, just for your account. So its akin to learning, but technically speaking is not the same mechanic that is used when we \'train\' the LLM, such as chatgpt, to \'learn\' by reinforcement and etc which is ultimately incorporated into its \'dataset\' as we abstractly call it, which is really a complicated system based upon a \'vector databse\' aka vdb. But you can just call it dataset or training dataset as we commonly refer to it in the industry.', 'Ill add to comments too the wroted promptt.

Fractals: solving the Information Paradox ?,"**Hello everyone!**

This started as a thought experiment about a week ago. I wanted to explore **In-Context Learning (ICL)** and **emergent capabilities** in advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Until now, I mostly tested these models in the other direction—trying to “break” them. For example, I had models write stories involving ethically tricky scenarios (e.g., priests, kids, and drugs). My goal was to test their morality and ethics filters and I successfully did it up until **o1** models.

So, why do I do this?

Pure curiosity! I’m a QA automation software developer, and sometimes I explore these things for fun.

**Now, to the Serious Stuff**

If what I stumbled upon here is legit, it feels “crazy.” I proposed a framework of thinking to an ChatGPT **o1pro** model and collaboratively explored a foundational physics problem: the black hole information paradox. This process resulted in what appears to be a valid solution to the paradox. You’ll see that I refined it into something that feels polished enough for publication (through multiple iterations).

**What This Means to Me**

If this solution holds up, it might signal a **new direction for human-AI collaboration**. Imagine using advanced LLMs to augment creative and technical problem-solving on complex, unsolved puzzles. It’s not just about asking questions but iteratively building solutions together.

**Am I Going Crazy or… Is This a Milestone?**

This whole process feels like a turning point. Sure, it started as a playful test, but if we really used an LLM to make progress on an enduring physics puzzle, that’s something worth sharing. And imagine the future ?

I suggest putting the content of the monograph attached in any advanced LLM and start playing with it. I usually start by copy pasting the content of the monograph and add something like this: is the math 100% legit and this could be accepted as a solution if peer-reviewed and published ? what’s your confidence level about the math introduced - based solely on pure math - is it 100% correct or are there any assumptions not attributed for or something left for interpretation ? is anything perfect from a math perspective disregarding peer review and publishing? give % on your confidence levels - compare this metric on similar already published research papers grade of confidence

Please be brutally honest - am I going crazy or am I onto something ?

**A ELI5 Summary of the monograph**

Black holes are like giant cosmic vacuum cleaners that swallow everything—*including* the information about what fell in. But in quantum physics, information shouldn’t just vanish! That’s our puzzle: **where does the information go?**

Instead of using fancy shortcuts (like huge equations or special “large-N tricks”), we imagine black holes as if they’re made of super-detailed, never-ending shapes called *fractals*. You know how a snowflake’s edges can look the same no matter how close you zoom in? That’s a fractal.

Here’s the cool part: we use simple math rules that say, “No matter how tiny the changes, the big, fractal-like system stays stable.” It’s like building a LEGO castle—switching one block at a time *can’t* suddenly break the whole castle if the pieces fit together correctly.

1. **No “Zero-Mode” Surprises:** Our equations show there’s no sudden meltdown in the geometry.
2. **Fractal Geometry:** Even if the structure is mind-blowingly complicated, its “dimensions” stay steady under small tweaks.
3. **Unitarity:** A fancy word for “information doesn’t disappear.” Our math says tiny changes can’t kill this rule.
4. **Compactness:** Even if complexity goes wild, you can still find a neat, convergent way to handle it.

Put simply, **the black hole doesn’t delete information**—it hides it in an endlessly detailed fractal pattern, which math proves stays consistent from beginning to end.

Quantum Computers vs Traditional Computers vs Photonic Computers,"We are approaching the limit of Moore's law, or physical limit of silicon-based electronic computers. And makes me think about the future.... well,

Quantum computers cannot be for household use, let alone be in smartphones as they need ultra-low temperatures to work, they are really error prone and even a little bit of vibration can cause error in computing. In these cases, traditional computers (computers as in laptops, smartphones, desktops, basically silicon chips used in such devices) are superior to quantum computers. They also just do not work with software which we use, it's like using a ship for commuting in land: it will simply not be compatible. 

Why are we even talking about using anything other than traditional computers? They are portable, compatible, basically the world is made according to such technology: we have charging outlets for our smartphones, desktops and laptops.... well the simple answer is: WE ARE APPROACHING THE 'PHYSICAL' LIMIT OF IT.

Here comes the photonic computers, basically computers whose processors are powered by light and are 'manipulated' in such manner that it behaves like a traditional silicon chip. It is still at its infancy, but it IS the future... There is a company called Light Matter and is making such 'photonic chips'.... They consume less power, similar to traditional chips, produce less heat, reduce latency (almost zero latency), better bandwidth and simply more speed (light is faster than electricity). We still have problems such as:  
1) Integration with both software and hardware  
2) Scalability and cost  
3) Controlling light (it is easy to control electricity unlike light which likes to scatter)  
4) and so much more..... but that can be solved at least, its problems are not like that of quantum computers?

I'd like to hear you guy's opinion and also correct me if I am wrong or I have failed to address anything...",49,55,"[""you don't need quantum computer to create word documents or listen to music. traditional computer is here to stay. they co-exist. when you need something with higher computational power we can use cloud data streaming. ~~and in distant future, quantum data streaming which is theoretically instant and no transfer medium required~~. for day to day use, traditional computer are sufficient"", 'Quantum servers could be used to stream to traditional silicon devices. There’s no reason why the entirety of the device needs to be replaced either.', "">Why are we even talking about using anything other than traditional computers?\n\nBicycles are super cheap, accessible, easy to manufacture and far more efficient than other modes of transportation. Why are we even talking about using anything other than bicycles? Maybe because we understand that other forms of transportation solve particular use cases better?\n\nWe cant even being to understand the possible use cases for quantum computers once they are mature any more than we could understand the use case of traditional computers when they were rooms full of hot, unreliable vacuum tubes. The earliest electro-mechanical computers like bombe were purpose-built to break encryption (sound familiar?) or calculate trajectories but from those designs arose all the advancements that gave us the general purpose computers we use today.\n\nIts a bit weird that so many people in this subreddit sort of miss that point. To me it doesn't take much imagination to look at our clearly primitive implementations of quantum computers right meow and extrapolate a few major innovations out and think about what happens when students in 2050 get some time to mess around with a $20K university acquired used quantum computer that now is the size of a couch."", ""**Photonic Computer**: It is only useful for a selective narrow range of analog tasks due to weak photon photon interaction and lack of nonlinearity and memory. It is nonetheless great for data transfer.\n\n**Quantum Computers**: Only useful for several physics and encryption applications (Shor's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm) and has no real use for 99.9% of tasks.\n\n**Classical computing**: Despite your understandable concerns about recent slow transistor improvements suggesting stagnation, we won’t face permanent stagnation. Instead, this recent stagnation will be overcome by new computing paradigms using vertical integration in memory (monolithic 3D RAM) and logic (self-aligned incremental stacked CFET) between 2030 and 2035, allowing scaling to resume. The IEEE Roadmap 2023 projects a twelvefold increase in logic density, primarily after 2030."", 'Waiting on isolinear chips so I can start building the Enterprise-D.', 'Build a true ai and then task it with designing a photonic computer.', 'Holiday feelings, sorry I’m drunk and I haven’t read the whole piece, just skimmed over it, but I want a photonic quantum computer cause it sounds cool. Make it so.', ""I've known about Lightmatter for years and I doubt they will have a general digital photonic compute device within  decade. I doubt anyone will have one. Everyone who is talking about photonics today either offers no computation at all, it's analog based or they lie to get investment money. Doing digital computation using light requires for said light to be able to interact with itself and this is not possible without a medium mediating such interaction as light is known for not interacting with itself. Even if materials with appropriate optical properties were found it doesn't guarantee that it would yield scalable computing technology. After all modern silicon devices have features much smaller than visible light wavelenght which would force the use of much shorter wavelenghts which are not easy to work with. Switching speed of light is also meaningless outside of communication as the frequency of a chip would be limited by the optical medium switching and not the light switching.\n\nThe best way to measure whether photonic computing is anywhere near being released to the market is to look at what the big players in chip design do instead of listening to what start ups promise (and fail to deliver).\n\nFrom my point of view superconducting computing has much better chance of actually being useful anytime soon but even this feels 15 to 20 years away.\n\nAlso quantum computing, while a somewhat different thing, is leagues ahead of either photonic or superconducting computers in terms of having an actual product on the horizon."", 'I made a whole [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/s/lFy2c873CU) about this very same topic and although highly speculative, my theory was that photonics will eventually displace electronics completely and not just single components such as chips but entire systems themselves thereby rendering current forms of electronics obsolete. What I am basically saying if it is not clear is that we learn to play around with light which is another wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum instead of electricity and we use light to do work instead of electricity. At that point, even the word ""electronics"" would stop making any sense because all devices at that point would no longer be using electricity directly anymore. \n\nUnfortunately the things that I talk about and foresee such as optical data and power transmission, optical power storage and optical wiring is not currently feasible together as a single unit, only bits and pieces are possible right now such as our current early forms of photonic chips and fiber optic wires. I don\'t know how long it would take to do something like what I envision, it could take 20-30 years, it could take 50 or even 100 years, nobody knows. Maybe AGI/ASI could help us significantly speed up the timeline to developing this nascent technology. \n\nNow if we are to assume that ""photonics"" are superior to current forms of electronics, it stands to reason that quantum devices are the next leap after that. But there is no way to know for certain though what this would look like. Maybe it might be a new form of circuitry like what photonics seems to require or it might just be a new type of sub-process or ability within the system that we didn\'t know was possible that could require only minor hardware tweaks.', 'Traditional computers will be more than adequate for home use for many, many decades to come.\n\nPhotonic computers will probably do the heavy lifting in big datacenters and will ultimately trickle down to the consumer market.\n\nQuantum computers are useless as general computational devices. They will be used for very specific types of computations that are not realistically feasible with the more traditional systems mentioned above.\n(Theoretically, we could have “normal” computers with some quantum computing unit, similar to a modern GPU, in some far distant future).\n\nFinally, there is the option of hybrid computing where sone of the workload is offloaded to the cloud.

The Future of Vision Restoration,"As someone who’s deeply interested in the possibilities of vision restoration, I wanted to share some thoughts and hopefully spark a conversation about the advancements that could really change the lives of people living with visual impairments.

Over the years, we've seen some incredible progress in both technology and medicine. From the development of bionic eyes to breakthroughs in gene therapy and neural implants, the future of vision restoration has never seemed more promising. While a lot of these innovations are still in the works, the potential they offer is nothing short of transformative:

 **Bionic Eyes**: Devices like the Argus II and other retinal prostheses have already helped people regain partial vision. The next generation of these devices promises to bring even better clarity and usability.

 **Neural Implants**: Companies like Neuralink are working on brain-machine interfaces that might bypass damaged eyes altogether, connecting directly to the brain’s visual cortex to restore sight.

 **Stem Cell Therapy**: Researchers are investigating ways to regenerate damaged retinal cells and restore natural vision. Trials are still ongoing, but the early results are promising.

 **Gene Therapy**: For those with inherited eye conditions, advancements in gene-editing technologies like CRISPR could offer personalized treatments that fix genetic defects at their source.

 **AI and Assistive Technology**: AI-driven devices are already making it easier for people with low vision to navigate the world, from object recognition tools to augmented reality glasses.

The journey toward accessible, widely available solutions is still long, but with the rapid pace of innovation, I believe we’re getting closer to a future where visual impairments can be significantly reduced—or even eliminated.

I’d love to hear from others in the community:

* Which advancements are you most hopeful about?
* How do you stay optimistic while waiting for these technologies to develop?
* What would a solution like this mean for your life?

Let’s share our thoughts and hopes. By keeping the conversation going, we can inspire those working on the next big breakthrough.",10,6,"['Not sure what you wanna discuss exactly. You seem kinda informed but it seems like you read headlines or news articles rather than the papers themselves.\n\nYour assertion of the different approaches is more or less correct but keep in mind we’re at the beginning really of some progress but it’s very slow. Retinal implants have been around for 20 years now and still provide very poor vision at best.\n\nStem cell transplanted have been attempted for a good decade now but still can’t transplant the most basic RPE cell yet.\n\nNeuralink and neuro vision devices haven’t got off the ground really and even more behind that retinal devices. They’ll hit the same performance plateaus and be stuck at phosphene vision for a while.\n\nGene therapies work for curing a disease when the cells are sick but still alive. Once they’re dead and the person is blind, you can’t use a gene therapy cause there’s no cells left to give the new copy to.\n\nSo it’s exciting there’s research but there is still many decades to go before restoring vision in a significant way. Prob 30-50 years more of research before we can take a blind or close to blind person and get them back to like 20/40 vision where they can drive again.']",2024-12-19 21:55:51,Constant-Line-513,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hi489q/the_future_of_vision_restoration/

A Minimalist Future: Could This Be Our Reality?,"Imagine a world where our needs are drastically simplified. A world where the working class needs only a bed and a table, relying on shared community resources for food, recreation, and even workspaces.

* **Economic Collapse:** A global economic crisis could lead to a drastic reduction in living standards.
* **Technological Advancements:** Advanced technology could reduce the need for physical possessions and traditional living spaces.
* **Societal Shifts:** A growing emphasis on community and sustainability could drive the adoption of shared living models.

What if the future of living looked something like this:

These companies valued talent across fields, investing in and nurturing it, creating opportunities that benefited individuals and society as a whole.

Today, the focus has shifted. Many corporations outsource to developing countries, exploiting labor by underpaying millions of workers. Talent is no longer prioritized, and the relentless competition for AI leadership threatens to displace countless jobs. Alarmingly, it has become commonplace for CEOs to boast about how many jobs their technology will eliminate, treating job destruction as a metric of innovation.

What will be the next computing device that will disrupt the phone...if even the phone can be disrupted?,"I have been thinking about how the smartphone completely transformed our relationship with computing and basically ate everything - cameras, GPS devices, music players, even our wallets. But lately, I'm wondering if we're approaching another inflection point.

Consider this: The smartphone's dominance is built on it being the perfect convergence of mobility, utility, and social connection. But what if this isn't the final form of personal computing?

Some interesting patterns I've noticed:

1) The phone is becoming a bottleneck for attention. We're constantly switching between apps, contexts, and modes of interaction. Our necks hurt, our eyes strain, and we're increasingly aware of how unnatural it is to be hunched over these glowing rectangles.

2) The rise of ambient computing - smart speakers, IoT devices, car interfaces - suggests we're hungry for more natural ways to interact with digital information. The phone feels like a middleman we're tolerating rather than embracing.

3) Our current interfaces feel primitive compared to how our brains actually process information. We're spatial creatures who think in 3D, yet we're constrained to tiny 2D windows into the digital world.

Here's my controversial take: The next major disruption won't be a single device, but rather a constellation of integrated interfaces that more naturally mesh with our cognitive architecture. Think: lightweight AR glasses for visual overlay, haptic surfaces for tactile interaction, spatial audio for ambient information, and some form of neural interface for direct input.

The phone won't disappear overnight - just like PCs haven't disappeared. But I believe we're approaching a paradigm shift where the smartphone's role will be dramatically reduced as we move toward more natural, distributed, and ambient forms of computing.

What do you think? 

Are phones truly at risk of disruption, or have they become too deeply embedded in our social and economic infrastructure to be displaced? 

What technologies or interface paradigms do you see as potential disruptors?",71,157,"[""Is it really fair to call a smartphone a phone in this question?\n\nPeople will continue to carry an electronic device that meets as many of their needs as possible, probably until they don't have to carry it because it's been integrated into the body or clothes.\n\nOf all the needs & desires it meets *talking on the phone* will continue to be at the bottom of the list like it is today."", ""It will be AR/smart glasses.  but I don't think that phones will go away because people don't like wearing things on their face."", 'My vote is for AR paired with an earbud. Once we have good tech for those things your phone will go in your pocket and there it will stay. Shortly after that you will just buy a computer that fits in your pocket and it won’t have more than a rudimentary display for pairing devices. I think developers are going to need a decade or two of coding and tweaking features on AR before our control over our tech environment really starts to branch out and expand after that. \n\nAR is a replacement for your phone’s main feature. The screen. Maybe you will still use the phone as a control interface while they nickel and dime everybody on every tiny iteration but once you stop staring at the damn thing all day long it will lose its relevance rapidly. \n\nAdblockers are going to be so much more important in the future.', 'I think reading some Cyberpunk books may help think about things in this field.\n\nThe classic:\nWilliam Gibson’s “Sprawl” series\nNeal Stephenson’s “Snow Crash” and then “Diamond Age”\n\nThen, another Stephenson book, Seveneves, shows maybe a step or two after that.\n\nJust some suggestions among the myriad great books', 'I think you\'re wrong. \n\nSmart phones (or something very much like it) will be a staple for the rest of the time technologically advanced society exists. \n\nConsider the button. Tech companies have been trying to replace it for decades. They were gonna do it with touchscreens, then with voice commands, now the ""car interfaces"" you reference are literally seeing a return to buttons and knobs because people actually prefer the experience of using them relative to the ""higher tech"" alternatives. \n\nWe always think just because something is ""higher tech"" that it is destined to replace alternatives, but this isn\'t the case. Higher tech doesn\'t just need to work, it has to work SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER than whatever it is replacing. On top of that humans brains are still primitive in a lot of ways, we like pressing shiny raised buttons because our brains are still wired to pick out shiny round berries and nuts. \n\n\n""Our current interfaces feel primitive compared to how our brains actually process information. We\'re spatial creatures who think in 3D, yet we\'re constrained to tiny 2D windows into the digital world.""\n\nI think you\'re giving our brains too much credit. We think in abstractions, and 2D abstractions are more efficient for most purposes. \n\nConsider maps. We have 3D maps... they exist. How often do you use them? I\'m willing to guess never for most people, because the third dimension is generally unnecessary. This is the case for most things you do on your phone. \n\nIn fact remember when video calling was going to replace all phone calls? You\'d see in sci fi every call was a video call where they could see the person\'s face? What happened to that? We\'re technologically capable of it...but we don\'t need it. For most phone calls we don\'t want or need to see the person\'s face. Even a 2d image was more than was necessary and most people just stuck to the efficiency of voice calls.\n\nESPECIALLY when it comes to devices we don\'t want more unnecessary ""fluff"". We want what gets the job done was conveniently and efficiently as possible and phones are amazing for that. \n\nThe only possible alternative is the ""AR glasses of the future"" that do everything a phone does in a transparent HUD. I think this is a false expectation as well. For the reasons I\'ve already mentioned moving all the same information your phone gives you into 3D isn\'t going to be a significant step-up. On top of that humans are REALLY concerned with appearances and our faces are the most sensitive parts of our body and human experience. Convincing EVERYONE to wear a peripheral on their face is not an easy sell so you\'d need some use case that is REALLY compelling to make it happen. We\'ll fiddle with anything in our hands though. \n\nDon\'t believe me? Take a random object with you onto the street and try to hand it to someone, they are likely to take it. Ask the same people to rub that object on their face and they will likely become angry and suspicious of you.\n\nComputer-brain interfaces are going to face similar hurdles I don\'t think anyone is anticipating. Sure, controlling an interface with your thoughts SOUNDS cool to tech-savvy people. But the average person doesn\'t want to learn tech mind-wizardry to make a phone call, and the moment they call someone inadvertently by accidently thinking about it, they\'re gonna trade in their CBI for a good old smartphone that has the barrier of intention that is their fingers without having to relearn how to move.', 'An anti-surveillance device or service (or even class of citizenry) that provides privacy.', 'Personal drone/phone.

As they developed, they too gained more functionality. Text messages came in with GSM, and subsequently both games, basic apps and basic data services followed as the internet allowed. Phones like the T68 had email support, basic calendar apps, and even an add-on (basic) camera. Paper based systems for having ""all the information I need with me"" like the filofax date from the 1980s, and were digitised with the PDA in the late 1990s. The moden smart phone is in essence the bringing together of these three sets of tools into a single convergent device. Likewise pocket cameras have a long history, and digital portable cameras were very much a thing before smart phones.  What the smart phone did was bring these separate and already established devices together and combined them into a single object, eliminating the need to have multiple discrete portable devices for specific tasks.\n\nThe core feature of this line of development is moving from multiple single purpose devices into a single unified device, because having everything in one place is just more convenient than having lots of separate ones. If we see a proliferation of connected devices that provide for natural ways to interact with digital information, I do not see them as replacing the phone at all, but as being peripherals to it that can be used as needed and as available. The phone (the name is anachronistic, but that\'s what we call it), is the computing core that drives all of these things. While the alternative is to have everything ""in the cloud"" and all the devices connect to that, I don\'t think the business model needed to support that model of everthing-as-a-subscription-service is going to win out. We have seen too many examples of useful devices ending up bricked when the cloud back end they depend on gets discontinued and shut down.', 'From someone who used to work at a computing research lab, the big thing in consumer side research is spatial and immersive computing. So AR/VR applications and what devices will support that.', 'For phone services and music, likely an implant or a wearable device that uses bone-conduction vs. ear drum. \n\nFor web browsing, likely a pair of glasses or visor of some kind that transmits the HUD directly into the retina to where you\'re not actually ""looking"" at a screen. Basically, AR to the brain. I would imagine this gets paired with the implant-to-implant communication systems that are in development to allow you to control browsing and apps and such.']",2024-12-18 02:44:57,Slimydog21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hgrvi0/what_will_be_the_next_computing_device_that_will/

"Ok, hear me out. ","As we all know we have a homelessness problem in the US. There have not been successful solutions to this problem that doesn't involve an extremely complex reorganization of how the government operates. 

I think a government subsidized, voluntary, military style, merit based housing and job training system that operates and majorily funds itself using labor from the homeless is a good solution as long as it's executed properly without any corruption. 

This way, they can work to help society using military style meritocracy that will get them on the job experience to ether move up within or even transition out of the organization to take care of themselves. It can provide Healthcare, Mental Healthcare, education, fun activities, sports and of course food.

How It Could Work

Food and Housing:
Homeless individuals would receive stable housing, meals, and basic needs, creating a foundation for rebuilding their lives.

Structured Training and Work:
Participants would engage in a military-style system that emphasizes discipline, skill-building, and merit-based advancement. This could include:

Skills Training: Education and vocational programs (e.g., trades, technology, logistics, or healthcare).

Military Service Roles: Performing essential non-combat tasks, such as logistics, construction, maintenance, administration, or disaster relief.

Path to Advancement: Exceptional performance and leadership could allow participants to move up within the program.

Transition Pathways:
Participants could use their new experience, skills, and training to:
Enter the civilian workforce in skilled trades or administrative roles.
Continue advancing within the organization into leadership roles.


Potential Benefits

Stable Foundation:
Providing food and housing offers immediate relief, meeting basic needs and reducing unsheltered homelessness.

Skill Development:
A meritocratic system fosters discipline, hard work, and tangible skills that are transferable to the civilian job market.

Restoring Purpose and Dignity:
Many homeless individuals struggle with a sense of purpose or belonging. A structured system that rewards effort and achievement could restore confidence and self-worth.

Reducing Costs of Homelessness:
Homelessness creates costs for public systems (healthcare, policing, emergency shelters). A program that integrates housing with training and work could provide a more sustainable solution.

Workforce Pipeline:
This system could address labor shortages in skilled roles (e.g., construction, logistics, disaster relief) by preparing individuals for employment.


Challenges and Concerns

Voluntary Participation:
Any such system must be voluntary to avoid coercion. Forcing individuals into military-style programs in exchange for basic needs could violate human rights.

Suitability of Military Structure:
Not all homeless individuals would thrive in a military-like environment, which requires discipline and adherence to authority.
A rigid meritocracy might exclude those who struggle with physical health, mental health issues, or disabilities.

Addressing Root Causes:
Many people experiencing homelessness face complex challenges, such as:
Mental illness and substance abuse: Without integrated healthcare and social services, some participants may struggle to succeed.

Trauma: Military-style environments could exacerbate trauma for some individuals, such as veterans or abuse survivors.

Stigmatization:
Linking homelessness with mandatory work programs could perpetuate negative stereotypes, implying that homeless individuals are “lazy” or “undeserving” of unconditional support.

Implementation Costs:
Building and maintaining housing, providing meals, and running training programs require significant investment, though this may be offset by long-term benefits.

Exit Pathways:
Clear, realistic transition plans would need to be in place to ensure participants can successfully reenter the workforce or continue contributing within the system.",0,60,"[""Before you start suggesting how to fix the homelessness problem, you should first understand why people become homeless.

This is why we have the Supreme Court decision for Grants Pass - criminalization is more profitable that helping people and has more lobbying support behind it, because companies also get cheap labor to make food and goods sold in the US so companies don\'t have to pay minimum wage or higher.\n\n  \nWhile not all unhoused folks have drug addiction or mental illness, creating a label that makes them an \'other\' means it is easier for us to be ok with dehumanizing policies (like the ones above where people\'s wheelchairs and belongings they literally can\'t afford to replace away) and assume there is something fundamentally wrong with them. The stigma this label creates makes it harder to even implement solutions like tiny houses or putting people up in hotels because, as a society, we now view homelessness as a moral and meritocratic failure, where you just didn\'t have the fortitude like the rest of us, when really the unique set of life circumstances and resources needs to be considered.\n\nEvery person who has a drug addiction started out as a kid or adult with goals or dreams or an idea of what their life would look like, or maybe not.

Or you know someone with an ""acceptable"" drug addition""  \naddiction\n\nHonestly, with the constant stress and anxiety of being unhoused, I\'m not surprised folks drink or use drugs and don\'t judge them for it. We all probably use them or know people who use them for a lot less frequent and intense experiences.\n\nPeople need stability and agency, which housing and money provide. Making the assumption that unhoused people have created their conditions and just need more discipline ignores a deep set of social, economic, political, and cultural factors.\n\nMany societies currently existing today and for thousands of years have provided for people regardless of their past, current, and future conditions and abilities rather than let someone suffer, struggle, or die out of a recognition of their basic dignity and humanity where they shouldn\'t have to prove or earn the right to live. My hope is that our sense of the future will recognize this and move away from further mechanization and merit that flattens us as individuals by forcing us into a pass/fail mentality around whether we deserve a bed or food.', ""I'm so glad that some other commenters have responded to this post.\n\nHere's the problem with the proposed solution.\n\nHomelessness is often (in fact, usually) a symptom of many challenges, including, but not limited to, poor mental health, poor physical health, addiction, mental or physical disability, substance dependency, poor communication skills, social isolation, low reading ability, poor language skills, lack of confidence, learning difficulties, childhood trauma, distrust of authority, family breakdown, misdiagnosis, criminal exploitation… I could go on.\n\nThese problems cause or exacerbate homelessness, and homelessness often precipitates or amplifies these difficulties. Even more tricky is when multiple challenges interact with each other in ways that obscure what's going on.\n\nWhile the voluntary system proposed by OP could, perhaps, address, is the vanishingly few homeless people who are focused, capable and motivated right now, and who need a structure to step onto, it fails to address the main bulk of the problem.\n\nHomelessness a symptom of a complex system of interacting problems. And the first rule of systems thinking is that when you intervene into a complex system, you can't do just one thing. Sure, you can try to—but the nature of complex systems is that your one simple intervention will have multiple, often confounding, effects.\n\nIt is frustrating to deal with complexity. We have been poorly served by our educations and not taught well about it. We instinctively want there to be a simple, definitive action that, if we apply it rigorously (with military discipline, indeed!) it will solve the problem. The trouble is, complex problems just aren't like that. They require addressing on all scales, from the local to the global, with multiple interventions that are constantly monitored and adjusted.\n\nSo where to start? I suspect that the first thing to do to address homelessness is to get information from localities, and to empower and resource localities to understand exactly what's going on there, and address it. In many cases, it will be the details that matter. As programmes progress, helping localities to learn from each other will be key. Programmes of intervention will need to change and develop as they progress.\n\nBut what'll it cost? Less than the money wasted by failing, as a society, to empower people to contribute to it. Every homeless person who becomes housed, cared for, and gainfully (or voluntarily) employed turns a net loss into a net benefit.""]",2024-12-17 20:41:18,alivenotdead1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hgka5q/ok_hear_me_out/
CO2 Emissions already set new record in 2024,"2024 has set a new record for global CO2 emissions, even before the year has ended. According to Worldometer, we have crossed 37.93gt of CO2 emissions, up from 37.79 set last year (Our World in Data). CarbonBrief published an article on November 13 that predicted a new record as well.

This comes at a time when we need to decrease ""spending"" from the remaining carbon budget. Hannah Ritchie, citing authors from Europe's Copernicus organization, estimates we have 100gt in our budget to have an 83% chance of avoiding a 1.5c rise in global temperatures (which may have already been crossed), and 250gt for a 50% chance of staying below that threshold. 

This year we used up a third of the best case and almost a sixth of the coin-flip chances to keep global warming under 1.5c. The time to decarbonize is running out at a shocking rate. We would need to crash down to 0 emissions in the next five or so years to even attempt to keep temps down, which is obviously not going to happen.

This is obviously important to the future, since a warmer world means higher levels of both drought and floods where dry areas get drier and wet areas get wetter. That will make food harder to grow and continue the rate of biodiversity loss, which will have knock on effects that are difficult to predict. These pressures will drive up both prices and conflicts as supply chains are disrupted by climate and food costs go up due to decreased harvests.

A new era desperately needs a new system ,"This is a revise from a previous post
We stand at a pivotal moment where automation and AI can revolutionize the economy, allowing corporations to drastically reduce costs while simultaneously unlocking human innovation on a scale never seen before. By automating menial and repetitive jobs, companies can achieve efficiency, minimize errors, and significantly lower labor expenses. This shift doesn’t just benefit the bottom line—it allows workers to focus on creative, high-value contributions that directly drive growth and innovation.

To support this transformation, a dual-system approach can be implemented. Universal Basic Income (UBI) provides a baseline financial safety net, ensuring economic stability for everyone as automation replaces low-skill labor. This eliminates the fear of job loss while maintaining consumer spending power, which fuels the economy. A Creativity Credit System rewards workers engaged in innovative, creative, or specialized problem-solving roles based on measurable contributions—be it in technological advancements, groundbreaking ideas, or critical artistic value. This incentivizes harder, profound thinking that directly benefits corporate growth. For roles that cannot be automated—like emergency response, complex care, education, and trades requiring human nuance—premium compensation ensures these essential jobs remain attractive and respected. These roles are critical for maintaining society’s infrastructure and will co-exist seamlessly with a more automated economy.

Studies show that over 50% of tasks across industries can be automated using existing technologies, potentially saving businesses trillions of dollars annually. Companies investing over 20% of their IT budgets into automation have achieved a 17% reduction in process costs, compared to just 7% for lower investors. In supply chain management alone, AI-driven automation has resulted in 10% to 19% cost reductions. Businesses adopting cloud automation report an 84% increase in revenue and an estimated 15% year-over-year growth. Automation in sales processes alone has reduced costs by 10% to 15% while significantly improving order fulfillment times.

UBI pilots in countries like Finland and Canada have demonstrated that financial stability boosts productivity and entrepreneurial ventures while reducing reliance on welfare systems. These programs showed that when basic needs are met, people are more willing to contribute creatively and meaningfully to society. Globally, 72% of companies now allocate a portion of their R&D budgets toward AI and automation, recognizing their potential to revolutionize business models. The cloud automation market alone accounted for 80% of IT growth from 2015 to 2019, generating over $200 billion in revenue, proving that automation fuels innovation and economic expansion.

This isn’t about replacing people—it’s about elevating them. Automation allows companies to eliminate inefficiencies, lower operational costs, and reallocate resources to strategic goals. Meanwhile, workers transition to higher-value, creative roles rewarded through a Creativity Credit System tied to measurable contributions. Corporations stand to benefit from drastically reduced costs as automation minimizes human labor expenses while increasing efficiency. A population freed from survival-mode focuses entirely on research and development, idea generation, and problem-solving. UBI ensures baseline financial security, keeping consumers engaged and markets thriving, while premium compensation for essential jobs ensures these roles remain attractive and vital.

By adopting this model, corporations can stimulate unprecedented growth on a national and global scale. Imagine the potential of multiplying the impact of history’s greatest innovators—Tesla, Musk, or Curie—by unlocking the creative potential of millions of people freed from repetitive labor. The combination of automation, incentivized innovation, and UBI creates a feedback loop of economic stability, consumer spending, and technological advancement.

This proposal offers corporations a clear path: lower costs through scalable automation, increased productivity through enhanced processes, and the unlocking of human talent for groundbreaking innovation. By embracing AI and automation, corporations can transition into an era where creativity and innovation become the lifeblood of growth, driving profits while redefining industries.

The Parable of the Boy Who Cried 5% Chance of Wolf ,"Once upon a time, there was a boy who cried, ""there's a 5% chance there's a wolf!""

The villagers came running, saw no wolf, and said ""He *said* there was a wolf and there was not. Thus his probabilities are wrong and he's an alarmist.""

On the second day, the boy heard some rustling in the bushes and cried ""there's a 5% chance there's a wolf!""

Some villagers ran out and some did not.

There was no wolf.

The wolf-skeptics who stayed in bed felt smug.

""That boy is always saying there is a wolf, but there isn't.""

""I didn't say there *was* a wolf!"" cried the boy. ""I was estimating the probability at **low, but high enough**. A false alarm is much less costly than a missed detection when it comes to dying! The expected value is good!""

The villagers didn't understand the boy and ignored him.

On the third day, the boy heard some sounds he couldn't identify but seemed wolf-y. ""There's a 5% chance there's a wolf!"" he cried.

No villagers came.

It was a wolf.

They were all eaten.

Because the villagers did not think probabilistically.

The moral of the story is that **we should expect to have a large number of false alarms before a catastrophe hits and that is not strong evidence against impending but improbable catastrophe.**

Each time somebody put a low but high enough probability on a pandemic being about to start, they weren't wrong when it didn't pan out. H1N1 and SARS and so forth didn't become global pandemics. But they *could* have. They had a **low probability, but high enough to raise alarms.**

The problem is that people then thought to themselves ""Look! People freaked out about those last ones and it was fine, so people are terrible at predictions and alarmist and we shouldn't worry about pandemics""

And then COVID-19 happened.

This will happen again for other things.

People will be raising the alarm about something, and in the media, the nuanced thinking about probabilities will be washed out.

You'll hear people saying that X will definitely fuck everything up very soon.

And it doesn't.

And when the catastrophe doesn't happen, don't over-update.

Don't say, ""They cried wolf before and nothing happened, thus they are no longer credible.""

Say ""**I wonder what probability they or I should put on it? Is that high enough to set up the proper precautions?**""

When somebody says that nuclear war hasn't happened yet despite all the scares, when somebody reminds you about the AI winter where nothing was happening in it despite all the hype, remember the boy who cried a 5% chance of wolf.",591,116,"['“You’ve been saying that the world is doomed by 2040 if we don’t address climate change but we haven’t been killed yet, so you’re clearly lying.”', ""You miss the part, where even people who had family members eaten by the wolf vigorously deny that wolves exist and even if they do, they're not a risk and even if they are, crying wolf still poses an unreasonable strain on the economy."", ""This reminds me of the Y2K bug, where everyone was saying it was a massive over reaction when nothing happened, while in reality nothing happened because of the massive push to address it.\n\nThe same thing is being said about to covid pandemic, a massive over reaction despite the staggering figure of 7 million people who actually died. That number would have easily hit hundreds of millions if nothing was done and it's scary to think about, there is no way the public are going to follow lockdowns again."", 'Another article that touches on this topic by Astral Codex Ten: [https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/against-the-generalized-anti-caution?r=6gi80&utm\\_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/against-the-generalized-anti-caution?r=6gi80&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true) \n\nSummary: \n\n1. If something is bound to happen eventually—like a person getting older or a technology reaching a dangerous threshold—early warnings are natural. When you see someone raising concerns too soon, it often just means they’re trying to stay ahead of the curve rather than waiting until the last second.\n\n2. Repeated early warnings can look like “false alarms,” making it tempting to dismiss all future cautions. But that misses the point. The person warning you may not know exactly when the risky moment will arrive, only that it will eventually. Being early doesn’t mean they’re wrong, just that we haven’t hit that moment yet.\n\n3. Treating every early caution as a failure sets you up to ignore genuinely useful signals. If the event really is inevitable, ignoring all warnings because some were premature leaves you vulnerable. It’s like unplugging your smoke alarm because it chirped a few times when you were just cooking dinner.\n\n4. A better approach is to absorb these cautions thoughtfully. Keep them in mind, weigh them against new information as it comes in, and don’t give in to the urge to dismiss them wholesale. Maintaining some level of preparedness is usually safer than insisting on certainty before you take any action.', ""No, the moral of the story is not that.\n\nThe moral of the story is that most accurate predictions come from highly educated people who don't know how to communicate with poorly educated people, yet the decision making is made by the poorly educated people because these are majority.\n\nSo the problem is that you have to educate better the mass of the people so they can understand nuanced issues.\n\nAlso, educate highly educated people on how to properly communicated with their less educated peers so they can understand.\n\nAlso, start understanding human psychology and anthropology. We're a society of apes who have become literate to varying degrees, but are still apes, with all their biases and short-sightedness and selfishness. We have to overcome these shortcomings.\n\nThere you have the moral of the story."", 'the flip side to existential risk is that your chance of winning the lottery is also not zero\n\nremember the cost part in that expected value analysis, and watch out for self-fulfilling basilisks ;)', 'This is why the kids need to be taught Bayesian statistics in High School. Because wolves.', 'Yet, people still buy insurance to protect against 5% or less probabilities all the time.\n\nMaybe the problem is less that the public is ignoring experts, and more that the public have many 5% risks that they must mitigate simultaneously.\n\nBy devoting all our attention to the wolf, we neglect the crops.', '5% chance is rolling a 1 on a d20. It does not always happen, but it will eventually, and it is ALWAYS bad when it happens. You have people who gamble big money on rolling a 20 that dismiss the possibility of rolling ones even though the odds are the same.', ""If you really want to screw with peoples' heads, and approach reality, now you go Bayesian. What is the probability of a wolf given that one did come after x number of false alarms? What is the probability of a wolf after x false alarms followed by n actual attacks. Doing statistical prediction can make your head spin, but they teach it to people all the time and the basic concepts are really understandable.""]",2024-12-15 14:39:17,katxwoods,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hetvh7/the_parable_of_the_boy_who_cried_5_chance_of_wolf/

A Future Where Creativity Replaces Labor,"
Submission Statement:
What if automation freed us from repetitive work, and society rewarded creativity and innovation instead? My vision: creativity centers for solving problems and innovating, with a creative currency system that replaces the grind. Baseline living (housing, food, healthcare) is guaranteed, allowing humanity to thrive beyond survival.

How would this reshape society in the next 50 years? Could it solve inequality and spark progress? Let’s discuss.

The system we live in is broken, and most of us are too blind to see it. Look around—everyone is grinding, working endlessly, and for what? To barely scrape by? To pay bills, sit in traffic, go to sleep, and repeat the same cycle until we’re too old to enjoy the life we have left? The world’s entire structure revolves around labor, but here’s the kicker: it doesn’t have to anymore. We’ve built technology advanced enough to free us, yet instead of using these tools to thrive, we’ve chained ourselves even tighter to a system that doesn’t work.

And let’s be real—this system doesn’t value you. It doesn’t care about your ideas, your passions, or your dreams. It cares about what you can produce, not what you can create. Humanity deserves better. We are more than machines made to work until we die.

What if we flipped the script? What if the future wasn’t about working to survive, but about thriving through what makes us human—our ability to think, to innovate, to dream? That’s the world I want to build, one where we replace mindless grind with boundless creativity. Imagine communities built around creative centers, where anyone, regardless of background, can walk in and contribute their ideas to solve real-world problems. These aren’t exclusive clubs—they’re open spaces where people collaborate and turn ideas into action.

Instead of tying survival to hours worked, we create a system where survival is a given. Everyone would have access to housing, food, healthcare, and transportation. Your basic needs are met so you can focus on thriving—not just surviving. This baseline frees us to focus on innovation. And for those who want more? We introduce creative currency—a reward system not for how much you sweat, but for how much you dream. It’s earned through participation and innovation, through solving problems and building a better world.

This isn’t about some utopian fantasy—it’s about using the tools we already have. Automation can take over repetitive and soul-crushing tasks, freeing humans to do what we’re best at: thinking and creating. For the jobs that still require a human touch, like teaching or caregiving, we reward those roles better and elevate their importance. The grind doesn’t have to define us.

The truth is, this system isn’t sustainable. Debt is out of control. Inequality is worse than ever. Depression, burnout, and hopelessness are everywhere. We’ve been conditioned to accept this life, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Imagine what humanity could achieve if we stopped grinding and started dreaming. Imagine a society where every person had the chance to innovate, collaborate, and thrive. That’s not a pipe dream—it’s a choice.

Now, I know what you’re thinking. “How does this actually work? Who handles the essential jobs? What’s different about this idea?” The answers are simpler than you think. Automation takes care of repetitive tasks. Essential jobs that require people—teachers, healthcare workers, builders—become better compensated and more fulfilling. And what makes this idea different is that it’s not just about basic survival; it’s about unlocking humanity’s full potential. This isn’t socialism, communism, or capitalism—it’s evolution. A new way forward that values people for their creativity and contributions, not just their ability to clock in.

If you think this sounds impossible, I understand. People are skeptical of big ideas, especially ones that challenge the status quo. But every revolutionary change in history started with someone saying, “What if?” This isn’t just my vision—it’s a starting point for all of us to build on. Together, we refine it, test it locally, and prove that it works.

I’m not saying it’ll be easy. I’m not saying I have every detail worked out. But I do know this: humanity is capable of so much more than we’ve allowed ourselves to believe. We can be more than cogs in a machine. We can create a world where creativity is currency, where automation frees us instead of enslaving us, where every person has the chance to thrive.

It starts with us. Right here, right now. Let’s take the first step.

Will We Know When Tech Turns Harmful?,"I just wonder, when we reach a point where technology does more harm than good, how will we know? 

In fact, you can argue it already does.

Societal changes creep up on us. I feel drowned in digital distractions. Even a simple walk now feels pointless without music or a podcast. It’s not just about chasing dopamine; it’s about the endless pursuit of novelty. Our minds are packed, our attention is short, and the promised tech “freedom” has become its own trap.

Technology has relieved us of physical burdens, only to replace them with spiritual exhaustion. It has closed distances yet bred new forms of division. Armed with all the world’s information, we were supposed to be absolved of ignorance. Instead, ignorance seems more pervasive than ever.

I’m still figuring this out. Some days I fail miserably at unplugging. But each morning offers a fresh start, a chance to reclaim our time, rediscover silence, and redefine what’s truly meaningful. Maybe in those quiet moments, we’ll finally recognise if we’ve gone too far.",1,28,"['Such a concept is fundamentally incoherent. ""Technology"" isn\'t a single thing or group of things. It doesn\'t act as a single unit or have a single measurable effect.\n\nYou might as well ask ""will we know when stuff turns harmful?"".', ""One example is the effect that social media has on teenagers.  There's been research showing a huge increase in depression, isolation, etc.  Jonathan Haidt is an excellent professor and researcher who has looked into this, and advocated for parents to restrict phone time and social media below certain ages.  Also there is evidence that social media companies were still targeting younger people with ads despite being aware of these things.\n\nThis has lead to a recent law passed in Australia banning the use of social media by anyone 16 and under.  There's still things to figure out on how to enforce this, but similar laws are likely going to be proposed and adopted by many more nations now.\n\nBut to your overall point, its true that it impacts everyone.  Its hard to fight distractions.  I've had to remove certain apps from my phone, use screen time to impose limits, and other things just to try and minimize issues I've had and stay productive.  Novelty provides dopamine so it can be habitual to seek it.  Unfortunately I don't think I retain a lot of what I've learned, and I've noticed I've rationalized learning about X our Y because I felt it was important in some way only to later realize it really wasn't.

Users behaviours decide what is good and what is harmful, not some ironclad ideology.\n\nPersonally, I think it's better to be connected. The idea that we should be focused on where we are now assumes that where we are now is the best of our time, which is rarely true.\n\nI also think the idea that, we evolved for a lower stress environment, so we should try to recreate it for mental peace, is a bad idea.

Streaming video games is the future of online gaming. ,"As technology advances and communications improve. I believe most large box office video games will eventually be streamed. 

This will allow multiple things: like not having using complaints about the game being 600gb and not having space for other games. 

This also allows for anti piracy and hacking, because upon purchase, all you buy is a product key or a paid account to said game, rather than allow the customers access to the code upon purchase. 

Updates do not require all users to be offline for maybe hours on end since updates happen on the back end. 

If players have no access to code, hacking is harder, especially if the server broadcasts you the equivalent of a video, so things like xray vision will be impossible since all the players are getting is broadcasted video of that wall. 


Lastly, this will also allow gaming across all platforms with a fast enough internet connection, a screen and a way to input button presses. Phones, smart fridges, toasters, an outdated pc, etc. 


I believe this will begin being implemented within the decade, or even as soon as they start implementing the new 3 million times faster fiber optic system.

Japan's birth rate plummets for 5 consecutive years,"Japan is still waging an all-out war to maintain its population of 100 million. However, the goal of maintaining the Japanese population at over 100 million is becoming increasingly unrealistic.



As of November 1, 2024, Japan's population was 123.79 million, a decrease of 850,000 in just one year, the largest ever. Excluding foreigners, it is around 120.5 million. The number of newborns was 720,000, the lowest ever for the fifth consecutive year. The number of newborns fell below 730,000 20 years earlier than the Japanese government had expected.



The birth rate plummeted from 1.45 to 1.20 in 2023. Furthermore, the number of newborns is expected to decrease by more than 5% this year compared to last year, so it is likely to reach 1.1 in 2024.



Nevertheless, many Japanese believe that they still have 20 million left, so they can defend the 100 million mark if they faithfully implement low birth rate measures even now. However, experts analyze that in order to make that possible, the birth rate must increase to at least 2.07 by 2030.



In reality, it is highly likely that it will decrease to 0.\~, let alone 2. The Japanese government's plan is to increase the birth rate to 1.8 in 2030 and 2.07 in 2040. Contrary to the goal, Japan's birth rate actually fell to 1.2 in 2023. Furthermore, Japan already has 30% of the elderly population aged 65 or older, so a birth rate in the 0. range is much more fatal than Korea, which has not yet reached 20%.



In addition, Japan's birth rate is expected to plummet further as the number of marriages plummeted by 12.3% last year. Japanese media outlets argued that the unrealistic population target of 100 million people should be withdrawn, saying that optimistic outlooks are a factor in losing the sense of crisis regarding fiscal soundness.",2517,903,"['There is absolutely not a ""Japan is still waging an all-out war"" ...

South Korea has sunk literally hundreds of billions into fertility rates, and not only did it not help, it’s actually still decreasing. \n\nThe thrust of the article was that none of these programs address the psychosocial aspects of fertility rates. Do the current generations want children for themselves? Is their local, national and international environment one in which they would want to bring a child into? Some studies have suggested that current generations don’t know why they would have a child, and in the absence of meaning to the act of creating a life, opt not too, even unconsciously, as the act of creating a child requires committed and concerted effort and coordination - unless someone actively wants a child, in the balance of things, even if they’re not actively choosing child-free, they’re still unlikely to choose having a child.', '""We need to increase the birth rate.""\n\n""How?""\n\n""Just do it""\n\n""What\'s the benefit?""\n\n""Just DO IT""', 'The companies/governments got greedy and made it not fun to be an adult.

Female friends knew that as soon as they were married, there would be intense pressure to have a child and drop their careers. Women who continue to work while having a child are judged harshly by other mothers as not being devoted enough, meanwhile many companies will not hire married women/mothers due to the expectation that they will not be devoted enough to their jobs, due to their many obligations at home. \n\nAdd on the fact that the average single income from the husband isn’t enough to rear a child these days, and women are in a really difficult position. My female friends were almost all on the same page, single life was the only way they could make enough money to live while still having some freedoms. On top of that, Japanese companies are so demanding of their workforce that men will be expected to spend nearly their entire day there. \n\nI heard of families where husbands and wives saw each other only a few hours a week, creating really lonely existences for women stuck alone in the home. Basically, married life is extremely unattractive for women due to social attitudes, and being single with a child is even worse. It’s frustrating, the government is not focusing on the right issues to solve these problems. I’m sure that’s only a piece of the whole puzzle but that’s one of the most common reasons I heard for why women were not having kids.', ""Numbers and statistics are useful but they don't get at the heart of the problem. The real issue is people are getting fed up with with our way of life.

Every society that manages to develop into a wealthy one has been following this trend without fail. We might as well assume that this is a natural law as unshakeable as the existence of gravity on earth is.\n\nWhile I do believe that a smaller human population long term can be a good thing, we are left with figuring out how we can sustain large amounts of elderly populations.', 'This is apparent, but not exclusive to Japan. It’s the new normal worldwide, and we need forward looking politicians and world leaders to make this happen. \n\nRather than fixing birth rates, the policies need to gradually ease into a new model that doesn’t rely on birth rate for taxes for a countries’ survival. Real estate can be recycled on tenures with a reversionary interest to the state. Consumption, especially medical consumption, will be significantly lower once the majority of the 70-100 age range tapers off over the next 10 years. This new normal isn’t that far off, but with world leaders still obsessed with birth rates, how progressed are we to really face this within the next decade? \n\nThen we have the biggest “enemy” of all, ever-increasing lifespans and not enough taxpayers to pay their medical benefits. I wonder if more countries will adopt euthanasia by this point to allow merciful and dignified ways of dying, instead of being an elderly at that point and hiding at home waiting to die because I wouldn’t be able to afford healthcare.\n\nEdit: I (millennial) would be one of those elderlies who won’t be able to afford healthcare by that point, but I do look forward to a less overstuffed earth.', 'One thing that people don’t mention about the social and economic aspect is uncertainty.

If I was making just a bit more (more aligned with the average in my mid-size city) or had someone else who made the same income, I think I could afford a child today if I really needed to take care of one. So at least in the USA, it is true that it is not a completely economical problem. But the problem is that life changes too fast nowadays. Society eighteen years ago feels completely different from society now. And while, things have always changed, I feel like it’s faster and we’re more aware of it.\n\nI could lose my job. Rent can become too expensive. Regardless of your political views, the next government is going to be very different from the current one. That is a really big change to go through every four years. And AI might take all our jobs. If I want a child, I want to have relative certainty that I can provide good basics to them for at least eighteen years and at most the rest of our lives (simply food and a roof etc .), and I can’t actually guarantee that at all.\n\nFor me that is a greater huddle than anything else. If I could guarantee that a child could have the life that I am having right now (and again, I make average salary and have an average job) it would be okay. The thing is our parents thought we would have their life and we did not. And I am self-aware that our kids will not have our lives. And it may be much worse.

Complexity of Hacking Techniques\n\n* Hacking requires understanding intricate systems, programming languages, and exploiting vulnerabilities. This expertise cannot be distilled into simple, foolproof instructions that AI can provide to a novice.\n* Even with step-by-step guidance, successful execution often demands technical skills that an illiterate person lacks.\n\n# 2. AI Ethical and Legal Safeguards\n\n* Most AI systems, including advanced conversational models like this one, are programmed to prevent misuse. They cannot and will not provide instructions or assistance in illegal activities, including hacking.\n* Attempts to ask AI for guidance on hacking are generally met with refusals or redirections toward ethical behavior.\n\n# 3. Real-world Obstacles\n\n* Hacking often requires tools that must be installed and configured, which itself is challenging for someone without computer knowledge.\n* Network configurations, security bypass techniques, and maintaining anonymity are essential aspects of hacking that require expertise far beyond basic computer use.\n\n# 4. AI’s Limitations\n\n* AI models provide general knowledge and guidance but are not equipped to assist with highly specialized, technical, or unethical tasks.\n* Even if AI provides information on general computer systems, applying it to a real-world hacking scenario demands understanding and adaptability, which a computer-illiterate person lacks.\n\n# Summary\n\nWhile AI can make some technical concepts more accessible to laypeople, it cannot replace the expertise required for hacking.

Can low birthrates be compared (to an extent) by a more child-friendly overall infrastructure l?,"So, I've been thinking about the difficult.parts of being a parent. 

Even for people with stable and sufficient income, there is still one hurdle: that of having to sacrifice so much time. 

What scares.me the most about becoming a parent is that it will be very difficult to maintain my identity as a person: my hobbies and interests. 

However, there might be hope. 

When I was a kid, I didn't want to be with my parents for too.long. I preferred playing with other kids, reading, doing homework, playing video games. 

Therefore, my question is; **can the issue of low birth rates be combated to an extent by a child-friendly infrastructure?**

What.is a child friendly infrastructure?
A city that has many indoor playgrounds, kindergartens, etc, wherein you can safely leave your child to play/read while you go and do your thing. 

For example, if you are a tennis player, to have enough availability of indoor playgrounds that it is easy to take them there (with adult supervision). 

Thoughts? ",1,57,"['I can\'t speak for others, but to me the lack of ""village"" is the main reason I am not likely to have kids.

And I\'ve met her kids - they\'re lovely.  If we still lived in literal villages, with kids able to run around and go play with their friends, make their own way to school, etc. with adults keeping an eye on all of the town kids, then hell yeah, having kids sounds great.

There are lots of parks and play places, indoor, outdoor, some that you pay for and some that exist in public parks.\n\nWhen you have small children there is only so long that they will willingly spend without you. You can’t just say ""go play"" and then you go play tennis. They want your attention. Especially when you work and don’t see them all week, they want to be with you. Slightly older children maybe but that is when they start to get bored at the playground and you better keep an eye on them so they don’t disappear or get in to trouble. \n\nWhen I was a kid I used to go outside and play for hours with all the kids in the neighborhood, and that was in Seattle!

Fertility rates are generally not correlated by access to social services, wealth, or access to daycare.\n\nI live in a city that has library programs I can take my child to.  But I go to.  It\'s nice and it\'d be sad if they ever cut it.  But absolutely none of these programs would be able to just randomly take an infinite number of children because their father has a drop in tennis match today.', 'So I have two kids and considering a third. \n\nI definitely have less leisure/hobby time but not none. \n\nKids go to bed early so any hobby that can be done in the evening is still fair game. Reading, video games, etc. \n\nFor daytime hobbies, parents don’t have to be on kid duty all the time. We each take time to go do our own thing. If you play tennis it’s probably not that big of a deal for your spouse to watch the kids for a couple hours, and then switch. \n\nFor other hobbies, the kids can be included. My dad’s big hobby was surfing, so he would take me surfing. My kid plays guitar with me, “helps” with woodworking projects, etc. My wife does DIY crafts and scrapbooking. As long as it’s age appropriate and safe, let them join. They love it. \n\nThe real reason for low birth rates is not complicated - it’s money. We’ve transitioned from large family communities to nuclear families with two working parents. That means paid childcare, which costs an arm and a leg, on top of all the regular expenses like food, clothes, medicine, activities, diapers. \n\nEach of my kids costs about $35k/year. That means the replacement rate of 2.1 kids costs as much as the average income. People find ways to make it work, but each cost savings opportunity is a tradeoff and paying for it is an incredible burden.', ""So there are two issues, the first is childcare. This should be solved at a government level. Govt has heavy financial incentives to better build out the birth->highschool graduation period. Aka socialized daycare and summer camps. Lot of good data showing this has good outcomes (and is also 'profitable').\n\nThe second is lack of third places. We really don't have them that arent schools or churches. It really is just gyms and parks that somewhat fill these niches. Gone are the days of malls, cheap arcades etc. This is a liability issue but also just a big funflation issue.  I think expanding the park systems would be a good place to do this, as well as subsidize large club type places (think ymca, boxing gyms, yoga studios, sports etc type classes) and somewhat help limit the liability. because liability is the big reason why these sorts of things have tried up and gotten really expensive. This could also be some sort of add-on to the school systems. Open school facilities on weekends for example."", 'Many of us are happy without a lot of children. I had one and I was perfectly happy not going for another. It wasn’t about expense per se. \n\nI didn’t want to have to move to a bigger place or have to drive different kids to different schools/events or spend my Saturdays at sports games, or have to attend so many parent teacher conferences. I already did those things.\n\nAnd I am lucky to have a “village” - there are 3 other boys my child’s age on the block and we’ve had an open door policy for each family.\n\nHaving a child has been an *incredible* joy, but life is nice with the one I have. And I have several friends who enjoy their lives *without* children. They have enough money and time, but just don’t feel the need.\n\nNow that women have more choices about reproduction (well…) many are happy choosing one or none.']",2024-12-10 14:13:45,AmbassadorAdept9713,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1hb2nxu/can_low_birthrates_be_compared_to_an_extent_by_a/

Narcissistic cofounder experiences?,"What’s been your experience with narcissistic cofounders?

I’m doing some research to help founders avoid the signs and traps. 

I’d like to be clear and acknowledge that the term “narcissist” gets thrown around a lot. There’s a difference between the full blown personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. That many have. Some would argue you have to be a bit of a narcissist to be successful in business. 

I’m talking about traits like insecurity, control, inability or refusal to experience shame. A grandiose sense of self that leads to overt or covert dysfunction and destructive behaviors. Professional love bombing or emotional injury and manipulation. 

I once worked for a family office run by a grade A narcissist that, after years of therapy, I believe has full in NPD. Almost cost me my marriage. 

I’ve also had cofounders with narcissistic traits that have been emotionally abusive and sabotaged success. I was susceptible for a long time until I got the help I needed. 

So, I table this topic not to vent or tear anybody down. These days I have compassion for founders that show these traits but can’t see their own self-sabotage. As an advisor I meet them every week. 

I’m curious as to how pervasive this problem is and what discussions would be productive. Startups are hard enough without cofounder dynamics. 

Thanks in advance and happy new year to you founders!",3,4,"['I’m not sure I would use the term narcissist with the problem cofounders that I’ve seen.  I would use terms like uncoachable and inflexible.  They still took the startup down on their own and were horrible.\n\nWhatever the term, they would rather fail on their idea then succeed on someone else’s even if the other idea was merely a pivot of their idea.  It’s a crazy dynamic.', 'All founders are perfect, what are you talking about 😂\n\nIn all honesty, the signs should be clear within the first 30 days of knowing them. The first sign is usually control in public. There is no willingness to let someone upstage them.', ""Oh I could tell you a story but the person's probably still stalking me. \n\nPsychopathic cofounder sabotaged and destroyed the company through deceit, triangulation, theft, abuse, malice. Tried to kill/intimidate and perhaps poison another cofounder and steal their identity/credit for all their work.  \n\nYou can't have compassion and talk to them, they exploit compassion and it's how we ended up in that place.  They view empathy and compassion as weakness to be exploited.  That's not even the full story, it's like something out of a Netflix series."", 'Yeah I got a story or two about this. \n\nThe problem is that “selling” is the aim of the game - that applies to both your product and “yourself” (meaning, the startup). By “selling yourself” basically what I mean is kissing up to folks to make a good impression to potential customers, investors etc. The founder(s) play a part in this - and the earlier you are, the bigger that part is. \n\nSo in order to succeed in that world - self-assuredness is a valuable trait. Unfortunately, that often bleeds over into just straight up arrogance, delusion etc.\n\nWhat I’m getting at here is that such behaviors correlate with certain personality types. There’s a level of “asshole” in many founding teams - not always, and not always overt. \n\nI’ve also seen this play out in companies with inexperienced, young co-founders who go through programs like YC. They’re told how fucking wonderful they are constantly, even though many of them don’t actually know anything about the real world. That tends to feed the above. \n\nI suspect I’ll get ratioed for saying that but I don’t care - it’s the reality.\n\nEdit: saw someone else suggest that “uncoachable” and rigid is also a common trait. I’d add that both of those may be interpreted as “narcissistic”, or at the least correlated.

Tech Startups?,"Good morning and Happy New Year. As 2024 comes to an end one of my resolution is to network with more entreprenuers in the Tech space.

How to validate your idea step-by-step without overthinking it,"I've seen a lot of people in the community (myself included) struggle with figuring out *how* to validate their ideas effectively while avoiding analysis paralysis caused by conflicting advice (e.g., ""Start with a landing page,"" ""Talk to people,"" ""Build an MVP YESTERDAY..."").   
  
After doing research and piecing together actionable steps, I've created a simple outline to sequence idea validation for bootstrapped SaaS projects (or honestly, any kind of startup).

This is especially helpful if you're trying to figure out the **right order** for approaching things like collecting feedback, determining demand, and building your MVP.   
  
Here’s the breakdown:

# Step-by-Step Sequence for Effective Idea Validation

# 1. Research What Others Are Asking

* Start by collecting **12+ threads or posts** (e.g., from Reddit, Twitter, forums, etc.) where people are discussing problems closely related to your idea.
   * Pro Tip: Focus on threads where users are genuinely frustrated or asking questions because that’s gold for identifying pain points. Specific details are important.
   * Take note of specific words/phrases they use to describe their problems — this will be key for messaging later.

# 2. Build a Simple Landing Page and Mockup

* Use the insights from the threads to craft a **waitlist landing page**. Address the pain points you discovered and explain **how your idea solves those issues**.
   * If your product has a visual component, include a **simple mockup using Figma or interactive screen recording** showcasing the core functionality. If it's a mockup, annotations will be helpful to guide the readers eye.
   * Keep copy short and focused on the core value prop. Borrow phrasing directly from user complaints/questions for authenticity. You've to make them feel like you've read their mind.

# 3. Start a Content Engine (Blog + Helpful Replies)

* While building the landing page, create a blog (I use Ghost) and write **answers to the exact questions you found earlier** in your research threads.
   * For example: If people were asking ""How do I determine the willingness to pay for SaaS?"" write an actionable blog post offering strategies and share it freely.
* **Be helpful, not pushy** — your content should solve *their problem* first and foremost.

# 4. Track New Conversations

* Use tools like **F5 Bot** (for Reddit) or keyword alerts on Twitter/Google to monitor when people bring up similar questions or problems again.
* When you find new conversations, **add real value in the comments** — include actionable advice based on your blog content and link back to the post only if it makes sense. Remember, adding real value means you can alleviate their pain. So be specific.

# 5. Build a Waitlist and Drive Traffic

* Leverage the traction you get from answering questions in comments and from social media to grow interest in your waitlist.
* Bonus: If you have a small marketing budget, use **targeted ads (fb or Reddit)** with the same research-backed copy to further boost sign-ups. Start with a $100 budget.

# 6. Use the Waitlist Feedback to Build Your MVP

* Depending on your sign-ups and engagement, you’ll have:
   * Real feedback on what messaging resonates most with your audience.
   * Validation of whether there’s a solid level of interest in your solution.
* Build an MVP focused **only on the core feature(s)** people care about most (the stuff discussed in the threads).

# 7. Sequence Your Launch & Build Hype

* Use your waitlist to create momentum for the launch. Share progress updates, showcase snippets of the MVP, and explicitly tie the product’s features to the **pain points from your initial research**.
* Any new value blog posts that you write, send them that too. This continues building trust.
* Example: If users in your initial research asked, “How do I collaborate better with designers on landing pages?”, your product should answer that directly with its functionality or resources.

# Revenue Calculations (Optional)

* Based on feedback I’ve seen and personal experience:
   * Aim for **20% of your waitlist sign-ups** to convert to paying customers.
   * Backwards plan: If your launch revenue target is $5,000 monthly and the product costs $50/month, you’ll need \~100 paying subscribers (so aim for \~500 sign-ups with a 20% conversion rate). Although, I'd consider anywhere between 25–50 subscribers enough to confidently start developing an MVP.

# Why This Sequence Works

1. **It starts with what customers actually want (not what you think they want)**
   * You’re validating whether there’s *real demand* by engaging with people who already have the problem.
2. **It minimizes upfront risk.**
   * Instead of spending months building a product no one wants, you test the idea through a landing page and waitlist traction.
3. **It builds your audience first.**
   * By engaging early and offering value (e.g., blog posts), you nurture potential users while still testing the waters.
   * At the end of the day, you'll have to launch at some point. And you'd rather have people ready to open their wallets or scratch and claw to find your first users. This way is better.

# Closing Thoughts

I know it can feel overwhelming when you’re starting out with idea validation. But following a structured sequence like this can help you stay focused, reduce wasted time, and get to **real validation** sooner.

What are your thoughts?

**TL;DR**  
Success in idea validation hinges on understanding your users’ problems first. Start with research, validate with a waitlist landing page, and build content to foster engagement. Use that momentum to build your MVP and strategically launch while keeping the users’ initial pain points front and center.",4,1,"['It’s a solid plan. I’d like to offer that it is one of many possible plans based on context. SaaS is broad and depending on the problem and industry, steps like discussion threads and landing pages might not apply. \n\nThe principle of listening to what others are saying is bang on. But what if they don’t talk on the discussion threads? I know a founder that raised a million pre-seed by having conversations with industry contacts on the phone that would never discuss on an online forum. \n\nThis founder also raised using a mock up versus a landing page. Landing pages are great for certain contexts. They bomb for others and founders that didn’t factor in context hey disappointed. \n\nAgain, the principles of this list are great. But context will change virtually every step in some form or another based on the startup.']",2024-12-30 13:43:25,shavin47,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hpnhfi/how_to_validate_your_idea_stepbystep_without/
Non Technical Cofounder does no work.,"My friend and I decided to create a startup a few months ago. I was supposed to be the technical cofounder and he was supposed to be the non technical cofounder. He has 2 other pretty successful businesses but these businesses are in a completely different industry than tech. They are more centered around direct to consumer products rather than a B2B Saas tool that we are trying to create. Before we really got into it he told me that he didn’t have much time on top of his other businesses but since we would be equal partners(he also chipped in some money) he would do what needed to be done.

 It has been a few months now and it feels like his entire work style just doesn’t work in a tech startup. He insists on contracting almost all work that he has been tasked with which normally would be fine but really drags out the process. I’ll usually ask him what he’s been working on during  week and there will be no results except for monitoring the work the contractors are doing. I’ve told him pretty directly to work on some things like a pitch deck and some documentation which I don’t interpret as a crazy amount of work and he just won’t do it. 

At this point I’m a little bit lost. I understand the importance of non technical cofounders however a lot of the things I ask him to do and he isn’t able to do are things that I feel like I could do in 20-30 minutes instead of it being dragged out. I understand how swamped he is with his other businesses but it feels like this new one is just not a priority to him and I’m curious how things are going to be after launch where I feel the non technical role only becomes more demanding. I’ve expressed these concerns to him and his response was he like to take the laziest approach possible and make his money work for him which isn’t invalid there are many business men who think like that but I feel all of this goes against what I know about tech startups being scrappy quick and as cheap as possible. 

I’m wondering how to proceed with this situation. There’s a part of me that believes every member of a founding team should be have some ability to be able to implement and take action but he seems to believe that it is okay for him to play a high level management role even though it is just the two of us and a contractor and all of this is just resulting in more work for me.",32,48,"[""Honestly if it's a technical product you are better off ditching non technical people unless they bring a very specific value to the org (raising capital, sales connections, etc.)\n\n\nIdea people and non techs are a dime a dozen and in most cases they expect everyone else to work while they reap the benefits.\xa0\n\n\nLike any good org or manager, it's important to recognize dead weight and remove it.\xa0"", 'This sounds like a cultural mismatch.

Struggling to manually do the marketing part of my startup,"As an early-stage founder, I’m manually handling all the outreach for my startup. This means every day for hours: I write personalized DMs to people on X and LinkedIn, carefully tailoring each message. Then there’s the email outreach - finding leads that'll be a good fit, researching them, and crafting personalized emails from scratch.

It’s exhausting and takes up so much time! I know there are tools that could automate parts of this, but most are pricey, and as a bootstrapped startup, every dollar counts.

Anyone else in the same boat? How do you manage outreach efficiently without breaking the bank or getting exhausted? Open to tips, tools, or hacks that have worked for you!",19,19,"[""Don't use tools IMO. Contacting people personally and purposefully is the way to go.

Fancy a discussion about a mutually beneficial relationship?”  Do you understand how cheesy social media outreach is?  Do you understand how hard sales is?

Another hack is using [**Apollo.io**](http://Apollo.io) or [**Hunter.io**](http://Hunter.io) to quickly find and verify emails so you’re not spending hours digging through profiles. If scraping leads is the time sink, **Instant Data Scraper** (a free Chrome extension) can pull data directly from LinkedIn or other websites, which speeds up the process. The key is balancing automation with personalization—automate the repetitive stuff (finding leads, follow-ups, tracking) and spend your time focusing on the parts that actually need your human touch. It’s still a grind, but these tools can save you hours without breaking the bank.', ""You are doing it right by not using the tools.. at this stage it is supposed to be exhausting if you are bootstrapping.. no one's heard about you/ trust you but the passion will show.

Startup Infrastructure,"First let's establish the tech stack:

* Frontend: React
* Backend: Node / Express / Supabase ( auth + db )
* Domain: Registered in Cloudflare

Second why this post:

While I know I could just throwing my projects into AWS without much consideration I would prefer to take an approach that meets these three criteria:  


**Simple:**

While I could spend the next 1-4 weeks diving into how dev ops should be done and how to securely deploy my services in a way that won't bankrupt me if I make a mistake i'd prefer to focus on developing the product knowing that I can sleep at night without incurring a $5000 AWS bill for compute resources. 

Also simple in the sense that I wouldn't need to use too much of my time maintaining containers or updating things to keep it running.

**Safe:**

I'd like to know that I haven't misconfigured something in AWS in such a way that I can potentially cause some security vulnerability or allow bad actors to take our services down.

**Scalable:** 

I'd also like that to an extent I could easily scale the frontend / backend to meet the needs of the business up until the point it is required to either hire or contract someone who actually knows how to build out these systems to be cost effective / scalable. Ideally it would be automated.  
  
Now to the point:

I humbly accept that while with my current knowledge I could absolutely throw the projects into services in AWS and have them running just by hacking away at. While looking online on forums like Reddit I was looking at the managed services offered by AWS ( Amplify, Lightsail, Fargate, Cloudfront ect) and it seemed like a good fit where you can essentially pay slightly more but have AWS spin up all the services under the hood which complies with some kind of proven blueprint whereby you can focus more on the actual product and worry less about the infra.

I seem to see a lot of contradicting posts on Reddit about these services suggesting to stay away and just simply ""throw it in an ec2 instance"" due to scalability or cost related issues.

While I would love to dive into devops and really learn the ins and outs I've ended up in a tailspin of analysis paralysis in choosing the right solution to deploy version 1 to our customers and honestly on top of a 9-5 it's a bit much to not only then continue to develop / maintain the project but also to really understand / deep dive into devops.

Planning to start a community of 4 AM Risers & Builders,"For the past month, I've been waking up at 4 AM, and it's completely transformed my life. The peace, productivity, and personal growth I've experienced have been incredible. Now, I want to build a community of dedicated 4 AM risers who can support and inspire each other.

* Weekly goal-setting sessions to maintain momentum
* A space to share victories, challenges, and growth experiences
* Tips and strategies for maximizing those precious early morning hours

𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟒: 𝐀 𝐘𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐬 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫,"As 2024 ends, I’ve been reflecting on the year. It’s been a year of many firsts - some exciting, some tough, and all of them unforgettable.

💡 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐩 : At the start of the year, I was running an agency. Life was comfortable, but I wanted more. I had an idea for Vizio - a tool to help content teams/Video Editors/Creators . It was just a scribble in my notebook back then. For the first time, I decided to take the leap and turn that scribble into something real.

⚙️ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 : We built the first version of Vizio with many features we thought people needed. But it was too complex - users struggled and didn’t even try. We trimmed it down to solve one clear problem, and it clicked.

🤝 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐭 : This year, my technical cofounder left, and everything came to a standstill. As a non-technical founder, I felt lost. After weeks of searching, I found someone great on YC’s cofounder-matching platform, and we started rebuilding together.

🎉 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 : I’ll never forget the day our first customer used Vizio. It was a small step, but it felt like a giant leap. Since then, we’ve grown to 100+ happy customers. Each one makes me believe in this dream even more.

📚 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐮𝐫𝐞 : This year, I almost failed a semester in college. I wasn’t upset about it. I was proud - because while my grades were slipping, I was creating something that people were actually using and finding valuable.

😞 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐟 𝐍𝐨 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐬 : There was a month when everything felt stuck. We were showing up daily, giving it our all, but no new customers came in. Those days tested us. But they also taught us patience and persistence.

💪 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐅𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 : Through all the ups and downs, what makes me proudest is my team. We’ve faced rejection, failures, and tough decisions together. Yet, we’re still here, excited and ready to build something amazing.

As we step into 2025, I’m more excited than ever to keep building Vizio - to help content teams simplify content production.

Biggest take aways from the business books I've read this year!,"Because the year is coming to an end, I decided to go through my notes and list out some of the most important business ideas I learned about this year. A lot of this stuff is pretty simple stuff, but it still can be very powerful.

**My 2024 Business Lessons**

* When you come up with an idea, you must actually test if people have that problem. This will save a ton of wasted time on product ideas that nobody actually wants. **(The Lean Startup)**
* Use a build-measure-learn feedback loop figuring out what the customer doesn’t like and make iterations as quickly as possible. Work in small batches to achieve faster iterations. **(The Lean Startup)**
* The right people are much more important than the right ideas. Ideas come from people therefore people are more important. I cannot stress enough how important great people are to a business. **(Creativity, Inc.)**
* To make a great product, the makers must pivot from creating a product for themselves to for others. **(Creativity, Inc.)**
* To be original you must do a lot of volume/work. “Quantity is the most predictable path to quality.” **(Originals)**
* Never worry about giving away too much free value to customers. **(Building a Storybrand)** <-(lots of great copywriting tips)
* The more lives you positively impact, the more wealth you’ll attract. **(The Millionaire Fastlane)**
* Great customer service is imperative because customers are great forms of advertising via word of mouth. **(The Millionaire Fastlane)**
* The easiest way to make a great product is to make something you want to use. **(Rework)**
* Ideas are treated like gold, but the real gold is good execution. **(The Millionaire Fastlane & Rework)**
* Launch your product as fast as possible! If you had to launch in 2 weeks, what would you cut out? **(Rework)**
* Instead of out spending or out selling competitors, out teach them **(Rework)**
* The most important customer service tip is speed; get back to them fast! **(Rework)**
* Dive deep into the ideal customer. Really try to understand them. **(Build)**
* Deadlines force you to get shit done! They inspire creativity. **(Build)**
* The best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins. Great ideas eliminate actual problems, not fulfill lightly desired wants. **(Build)**
* “What you’re building never matters as much as who you are building it with.” Once again stresses the importance of people. **(Build)**
* Make an incredible product for 1 audience not a so-so one for a bunch of different audiences. (Find a niche) **(The Mom Test)**
* If the audience doesn’t care enough to be actively trying to solve the problem, they probably won’t care about the solution. **(The Mom Test)**
* Product First, Marketing Second, Sales Third **(The Trillion Dollar Coach)**
* Become active in the community/niche involved with your potential product. Look for problems within the community to solve. Build strong connections in the community by contributing. **(The Minimalist Entrepreneur)**
* Before marketing/sales, really try to get your first 100 customers through family, friends, and the product’s community/niche. **(The Minimalist Entrepreneur)**
* Try to create a niche to avoid competition. If not, try to iterate until the product idea is completely original. **(Expert Secrets)**
* Encourage dreams, justify failure, allay fears, confirm suspicions, and throw rocks at enemy (marketing from the customer's point of view) **(Expert Secrets)**
* List out all the false/limiting beliefs that a potential customer might have that would make them not want to buy the product and try to debunk them. Eliminate purchasing risk. **(Expert Secrets)**
* Great reviews/refers go a long way; give discounts for them. **(Expert Secrets)**
* If you have a very good product, do collabs/promotions with influencers in the specific niche. **(Expert Secrets)**
* “The amateur is a weekend warrior; the professional is there 7 days a week.” Be a professional. **(The War of Art)**
* Use permissionless leverage to your advantage like media **(The Almanack of Naval Ravikant)**
* Become a creator who provides value in your product’s niche. **(Most of the books I read)**
* Don’t learn then start; start then learn. You must start as soon as possible. **(Most of the books I read)**

Product vs. Execution ,"As a new founder, I have read a lot of books and guidance that suggest just getting your product 'out there' to see if it's a good idea or if people are interested in buying it.

But my struggle with this is unless you have a strong product / marketing / pr person on your team you could assume people don't like the product, but it's actually a great product and the issue is marketing or messaging.

For example, maybe I'm using the wrong channel / medium and it's just not my audience. Maybe the product is great for my target audience, but the messaging doesn't properly explain what we do or why they should use us.

Self-funded, so we don't have unlimited funds to run tests, but we've worked with a few consultants that have helped, but most of our learnings have been trial and error.

My bigger question is, how have founders - especially technical founders who like me aren't particularly skilled in GTM - evaluated product / market fit?

And what are realistic KPI's? Is it free trial signups? Website traffic? Paid customers? Email clicks? All of it.

How do people know when they're on the right track and when something needs to change? I want to pivot when it makes sense to pivot, but not jump the gun so I'm flip flopping every week before giving something a chance to succeed.",0,16,"[""Following is what I've gathered from personal experience as well as learning from experienced founders; hope that's helpful \n\nYour early product needs real users who love it, not just quick growth.

The key to understanding what to work on > validating ,"I’ve wasted so much time the first time starting a business. I overdeveloped, spend way too much time thinking about every detail. Also spending way too much money. Pitch and business plan iteration after iteration. Now I finally have a different solution that just seems to work so much better.

If you start a business. You’ve probably heard the word “Validation” a lot. And me too. But I just had no idea when to validate.

Do I need a fully functional product or do I just tell people my idea? Do I collect feedback and instantly incorporate it before approaching the next person or do I wait untill I have more data?

Now I set 1 golden rule:

“Come up with assumptions that validate your idea and do nothing else but finding evidence that your assumptions are correct.”

The only focus should be to validate your own assumptions. As quickly and efficiently as possible. Example:

Idea: I want to start a brand that sells shoelaces in cool artistic style. With the right influencers I can make it trendy and hyped.

Assumptions:
1. People like customized shoes. So they will probably like special laces.

2. People would pay a premium for “hyped up” clothing items that feel/look premium/sustainable.

3. Influencers would love to collaborate on this idea if I send them free products.

THEN THE ONLY THING I DO IS SEEK VALIDATION FOR THESE 3 QUESTIONS. 

I talk to some people who I think would like this product. I ask what they would pay for laces. And I start DM’ing influencers acting like the product already exists.

Only if all my assumptions are correct. Will I continue my usual program of deck building, product research and more.

I wish I did it like this ages ago.

If you are in the middle of your startup and it’s not really going as expected. Backtrack and try this. 

And if your assumptions are not being validated easily enough. It’s not worth pursuing. ",5,5,"['That’s a lot of overthinking.\xa0\n\nValidation can be as simple as getting an idea, and asking some people if they’d pay X money if you deliver it under conditions Y by time Z.\n\nNo need to write long paragraphs about anything.\xa0', 'Validation is the process of confirming that your idea, product, or service solves a real problem for a specific target audience and that there is demand for it. It’s not a one time event, you are always validating whether it’s new ideas, new customer bases, changes to existing things it’s just how you setup your feedback loop and interpret the results.', 'Does it pass the Mom Test?

"Code, Chaos, and Finding Truth: A Journey to Digital Wasteland","Two months ago, I sat in my room staring at my resignation letter, knowing I was about to throw away a perfectly good backend developer career. Why? Because I finally understood something that would change everything: most of what we're taught about building tech products is beautiful, polished garbage – the kind that keeps you up at 3 AM, your mind screaming that something's fundamentally wrong.

**The Breaking Point**

You know that moment when you realize you've been living someone else's dream? There I was, surrounded by browser tabs full of entrepreneurship courses, market research guides, and growth hacking strategies. My desk looked like a shrine to startup culture – sticky notes with ""MVP"" and ""SCALE"" plastered everywhere. Man, I even had one of those ""HUSTLE"" posters. What a joke. Every night, I'd lie in bed with this sick feeling in my gut, my thoughts racing: ""This isn't us, man. We can't do this bs. It's not who we are.”

Here's what they want you to believe (and what kept me tossing and turning):

* You pick a profitable niche (that bores you to tears)
* You research your ""target audience"" (people you'd never want to have coffee with)
* You ""provide value"" (whatever that means)
* You ""scale"" (while your soul slowly dies)
* You ""succeed"" (but can't look at yourself in the mirror)

Each time I tried to follow these ""proven strategies,"" it felt like swallowing poison. My subconscious would revolt at night.

**The Moment Everything Changed**

One day, I just snapped. Threw all that conventional wisdom out the window. Because here's the truth: I don't want to build for people with fat wallets. I want to build for the misfits, the artists, the code poets. My people – the ones who live for software, electronic music, art, and design. Then came the real questions. When I stopped trying to be what I'm not, these started haunting me:

* What if the process matters more than the end goal?
* What if authenticity isn't just a buzzword?
* What if building something true is better than building something profitable?
* What if our daily frustrations are actually pointing to what we should create?

**Finding My Own Madness**

Then I stumbled upon Greg Isenberg's idea that everything we do is a product. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I stopped looking outward and started looking inward, into the chaos of my own mind. Because maybe, just maybe, the answers weren't in some mentor's PDF guide but in the things that kept me up at night.

**The Daily Grind's Hidden Gems**

Now I question everything I touch in my daily life. Every app that annoys me, every workflow that feels wrong, every tool that doesn't quite fit. These aren't just irritations – they're breadcrumbs leading to something real.

**What's Actually Working**

Here's what I've learned from my time in the wilderness:

* Trust your gut when something feels off
* Build for people you actually give a damn about
* Make the process as important as the product
* Let authenticity guide you before money
* Question the mundane – it's hiding gold

**The Road Ahead**

I'm working on something different now – a collection of weird, organic ways to find inspiration for tech projects. Not your usual ""validate your MVP"" bs, but real, raw methods that might help you find your own path through this maze.

Maybe you're like me – tired of the same old advice that feels hollow. If you've found your own twisted path through this entrepreneurial jungle, I'd love to hear about it. After all, we're all just trying to build something true in this digital wasteland.",11,7,"[""I can relate in some way.

My main expertise is cryptopology and most of the tools that I can wield are means of ensuring user/business privacy. However, last year trying validating my business ideas with these mechanisms I had to face plenty of discussions with possible customers about the actual value of privacy that it will provide to their business and what a possible RoI is and at the same time trying to come up with possible market penetration forecasts. After 4 months of fighting all these issues I decided to not care at all.\nI'm convinced that this stuff is useful and I will simply continue building it.

Advice on my blockchain startup ,"
Hey everyone,

I’m working on a blockchain-powered fundraising platform designed to make global fundraising more accessible, transparent, and impactful.

The idea is to integrate stablecoins and smart contracts to reduce fees, ensure milestone-based fund distribution, and make the process inclusive for underserved communities and social enterprises.

I’m looking for feedback on the concept, potential challenges, and ways to refine the MVP before launch. If anyone has experience in blockchain, crowdfunding, or scaling startups, your insights would be invaluable.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and suggestions!

I’m down for a quick chat as well! ",0,62,"['Have you spoken to any customers? Is there a need for such a product?

It sounds like a fancy solution to not an actual problem.', 'I’m curious how you envision your solution makes the process more inclusive for underserved communities?', 'What is YC 25 ?

If your really set on continuing I would stop all building and do more market research, who would buy it?', 'Surely this is just a bunch of fungible (eg ERC20) tokens being created and people being able to invest in the projects those tokens represent.

Stripe have best and lowest fraud rates in the industry as a payment provider, but they still charge comparably with mastercard/visa because it's essentially a monopoly and there will also always be some fraud costs to mitigate. platforms like gofundme are ontop of this and hence costs rise to 10%. in principle a crypto platform could work but in practise what is required/what is feasible. im not following the space but to my knowledge no platform (e.g. bitcoin/ethereum/doge) has reduced end-of-the-day transaction and transfer costs to the users more than the 'loss leader' of a simple bank transfer which is 'free' AND prevented volatility. Most stable coins suffered from volatility until a critical mass, but to get into them how are you going to capture the value in the form of the original donations? - - it will be mastercard/visa/stripe which will have fees, then if value is held in the stablecoin it could only reduce fees/costs if the value is used as collateral to release 'real' fiat funds, or otherwise you expect to create a network of orgs that hold value in these stablecoins indefinitely, which is ambitious.""]",2024-12-29 16:19:02,No-Fisherman-8894,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hozbz7/advice_on_my_blockchain_startup/

"Seeking Advice on Scaling Our Startup: Marketing, Cloud Costs, and Attracting Foreign Investors","**Hello Everyone,**

I am seeking advice and survival tips for my startup.

**A Little Flashback**

Back in 2021, my team lead and five colleagues from my previous company decided to pursue an idea for a startup. The main plan was from our team lead. The plan was for the team lead to secure clients and funding while also contributing as a developer. Meanwhile, the rest of the team would learn coding and start developing our product. We accepted that as we all were in IT support and had eager to learn coding.

In 2022, I transitioned into a DevOps role with moderate expertise in Django and helped build a product. One of my colleagues became a C# developer. However, by late 2022, everyone except me and the team lead left the startup. Currently, the team lead owns 80% of the company, while I hold 20%.

By mid-2024, we successfully developed four stable products. We sold the Django-based app to multiple businesses, including two high-profile companies that are actively using it.

**The Issues**

We now have nine employees, excluding me and the CEO. Starting in early 2025, we expect to generate approximately $4,000 per month in service sales. However, we are facing several challenges:

1. **Marketing:** We have not spent any money on marketing, which limits our growth potential.
2. **Expenses:** The $4,000 revenue will primarily go toward employee salaries, cloud bills (AWS), and office costs.
3. **Cloud Costs:** A significant portion of our expenses is related to AWS. I looked into AWS credits for startups, specifically the Activate Portfolio program, but I am unsure about the process. My goal is to maximize the credits we can obtain to alleviate cloud expenses.

**Seeking Advice**

* How can we secure angel investors from abroad? We are looking for investors who understand the potential of IT and can offer reasonable funding terms. Unfortunately, investors in Bangladesh often undervalue the sector and demand high equity in exchange for small amounts of funding, which could harm the company’s growth.
* Any tips for building a stronger portfolio to attract international investors?
* Suggestions on cost-effective marketing strategies to expand our reach would also be very helpful.

**Projections**

By the end of 2025, with proper marketing, we believe we can attract more large companies both in Bangladesh and internationally.

Your suggestions and recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",5,15,"['For marketing, focus on highlighting how your existing clients are benefiting through blog posts and case studies targeting decision-makers in your niche.

For funding, explore international angel networks like AngelList, SeedInvest, and LinkedIn groups, and look into grants, competitions, and accelerators such as Techstars and Y Combinator.

"I’ve been a solo founder for 2 years building my company, now I’m bringing in a strategy team of 6. What should I pay them?","**EDIT 1:** The team is my c-suite, they have experience in the industry and a network. I do not.

**EDIT 2:** thanks all, I’m learning a lot

I’ve scaled to six-figure ARR in D2C and am now leveraging that foundation to build a B2B platform. I’m heading into a seed round to scale D2C further, finish building out the B2B offering, and start piloting it with customers soon.

I’ve pulled together an incredible team with tons of experience in areas where the business is set to grow. Their expertise, networks, and ability to open doors are invaluable—things I wouldn’t be able to do on my own. While I don’t necessarily need all of them to keep the business running, their insights and connections could make a huge difference.

As a first-time founder with limited experience in this industry, I know having the right team is crucial. But I’m trying to figure out the best way to structure their compensation and equity. They’re experienced enough to justify strong offers, but at this stage, I need to be careful about protecting the company’s long-term equity and future hiring capacity.

How do I find the right balance between offering meaningful equity and keeping enough ownership for future hires and funding rounds?

Also, for roles that are more about strategic guidance or connections rather than day-to-day work, should equity be scaled differently? And since we’re still in the seed stage with revenue but not yet profitable, how should I think about salaries vs. equity-heavy packages?

I’m excited about what’s ahead but want to make sure I’m being smart and fair while building this team.

Stuck and unmotivated ,"You read it..... I am stuck and unmotivated. In March, I signed a lease to open my shop. I was on top of the world, after 2 years of planning with a S.C.O.R.E. mentor, I received a grant for my main machine, I had all my equipment, my suppliers, my location, and had an open date for 4/1/24. Our open date was planned to coincide with a large semi annual even across the street from our shop. Everything was finally coming together. One moment I was flying high, and the next, the ground was gone. 

  
Literally everything seemed to fall apart, all at once— 

Our location included 2 buildings. Building A was the main shop with seating. Building B was going to be used as an office/storage - future use will be for take out/drive thru. 

Less than a month after I signed the lease (paying deposit + 3 months rent), I wanted to give myself a a couple month cushion. We got huge amount of rain, and both buildings flooded. The flooding went on until end of May early June. Now we are 2 months past our open date. We live in a small rural area, local businesses rely of annual events for good revenue. Then next event was going to be July 4th. 

June 19th - My nephew (2M), that had been with our family for the last 18 months (long story), was picked up and taken by his biological mom, despite her absence, lack of communication, and against advice of our local sheriff's office. Legally I was stuck - my brother has no intention on being a father or making sure my nephew is safe. When this happened, I remember trying to file guardianship papers, the court clerk wouldn't file them for me, talked social services, begged her to do it gradually so he can get to know her. I don't really remember much of anything between then and mid- September. It hurts me to say that now because my fiancé and our 3 kids (12F,14F,15M) feel the pain and loss just as much as I do. (As an update, bio mom keeps saying we can plan visits, etc, but always finds a way to not show up.)  It's been 192 days.  - Ok back to business. 

July 4th - had no business even trying but we did anyway, we were going to open come hell or high water.....  instead it was ended up being electricity giving us the shock. building A wasn't fully ready so we utilized building Bs large open front area - until not a single electrical outlet worked in that room (there was around 10). Determined to salvage this disaster we move all our coffee pots, warmer, supplies into the empty future ""office area"" very small about 6 outlets but they at least worked! Until they didn't. Between breakers, confusion, and mayor AND BUILDING OWNER trying to talk to me in the midst of this mess I'm pretty sure I checked out and told everyone to shut everything off and go home. 

August - I reach out to the building owner because I know I haven't paid July or August rent yet. At first he seemed fine, and willing to work with me, than he started becoming very persistent about me paying him, I was getting multiple texts daily asking for the money (knowing I still hadn't opened, and with all the BS with the buildings). September I told him I did not want to continue with the lease, he made me feel very uncomfortable, not only emotionally but physically (he would literally look into the shop windows while i was working) instead of coming inside the unlocked front door of his building. It gave me the creeps. Also our county has zero building or health codes ( I know, WTF). 

Now it's almost 2025, my machine I got with the grant, was taken back (because) opening was one of the stipulations), so when they found out I wasn't going to open, they came and took the machine. All my other equipment, supplies, furnishings, inventory are stored in my garage at home.  

I've spent the last 6 months just trying to keep going, trying to manage, the business blocks, muddle through the grief, help hold our family somewhat together though all this, that I lost myself and my goals. Which is ironic bc I usually have about 3 plans, for each decade, for the next 5 decades constantly running through my head. Some days I feel like we are finally getting our groove back and will be able to move forward, than some days, I still spontaneously cry for hours because I pickup up one of my nephews toys or outfits. 

I have no clue what I am even trying to get out of writing this.  I am so grateful for having great kids, the best sister, a safe home. 

I can handle my shit. Always have. I will find a way through it.  Nobody tells you how lonely grief is, or just can't explain it.

What do you think of SaaS 2.0: Service-as-a-Software?,"A new term has recently emerged in the business world:  
**Service-as-a-Software** a.k.a. **SaaS 2.0**

In general, some authors of articles promoting this term assume that the new and rapidly growing possibilities offered by AI and automation mean that problems that were previously too individual or support-intensive can now be tackled. The focus is on (human) service on the customer side and the background processes in the company are fully AI-supported and automated. Unlike traditional SaaS, no software is primarily offered here as self-use.

In other words:  
**""Service as a Software"" (SaaS 2.0)** is a new type of business model that mixes software automation with real human support. Unlike traditional SaaS, which provides self-service tools for users to solve problems on their own, SaaS 2.0 focuses on delivering results by combining technology with human expertise.

In this model, software handles repetitive tasks like data processing, scheduling, or matching, while humans step in to provide guidance, handle exceptions, or solve complex issues. This approach is often called **Human-in-the-Loop** because humans are actively involved in key parts of the process, ensuring a personalized and empathetic experience for the customer.

SaaS 2.0 is especially useful in industries like healthcare, education, or elderly care placement, where trust and personalization are critical. For example, a traditional SaaS might offer a tool to search for care homes, while a SaaS 2.0 solution would also provide a care consultant to help families make the best choice. In this case no traditional marketplace is needed where the supply and demand side used to be scaled simultaneously. Instead, an AI can now search for the best match for a place in a retirement home and a human in the loop can be the external face for the customer and the retirement homes and thus act as an agent.

By automating routine tasks and using humans for high-value touchpoints, SaaS 2.0 delivers better outcomes, builds stronger relationships with customers, and stands out from traditional software that relies only on automation.

I have done user studies already for the idea that I have as well as competitive research and so far all of those have been looking great.

If it is battery powered, then It’ll be easier. You need to consider your PCB layout and parts select to reduce switching regulator ripple. If you control the brightness via PWM, then select frequency which won’t cause interference. I suppose it doesn’t have external connector port. If it has, then you need to add ESD protection for pins which exposed. If it is ac powered, then you need to consider more, such as how to suppress ac frequency and its harmonics. If it is  wireless controlled, you need to pass FCC. For example,If it is proximity sensing, then how to “filter out”the ac noise is the challenge. You can think how difficult it is to extract weak sensing signals from strong ac noise and also the thermal fluctuations also let your weak signal fluctuate. How to sampling to do FFT in MCU with embedded dsp core to suppress ac noise interference and regular auto calibration to calibrate out thermal drift of your signal.\n\nThe above is design part. Now talk about manufacturing: you need to find an ISO9001 certified OEM manufacturer. Usually check Chinese manufacturers for lower cost. But need to wait and see upcoming trade war tariffs. Taiwan an South Korea manufactures are safe bet. ISO certified manufacturers will save you when your product has some issues later found by consumers. They have batch/lot information of parts in your product batch/lot ( from serial number of product ). Do you know how to design test fixtures to test the PCB/ product? Write C code for MCU? How to audit manufacture: do they have AOI to scan 3D profile of solder paste? How they handle QA/QC? Do they have X-Ray inspection instrument ( if you have BGA package ICs, it is necessary).\n\nFor IP protection, you can file provisional patent first. It is cheaper and have one year grace period.

Dicey Exit,"I co-founded and bootstrapped a B2B SaaS product as CTO/CPO with my first-time founder CEO brother-in-law almost 3 years ago.

I’ve been doing SaaS startups for years and have seen many things. This one is a mind bender. My BIL and I’s relationship has rapidly deteriorated over the last year as I’ve built the product to be self-service, low-maintenance and low-cost to run.

I believe he now sees me as dispensable and hence wants to get me out of the company. I own 50% shares outright of the company and there are no repurchase terms.

My BIL has been gaslighting me on small things and the drama and magnitude of deception has grown to the point where I decided to resign from my operational role. He’s muddied the family relationships and has attempted to blackmail me to sign a mysterious offer to buyback my shares at peanut value.

I still have read-only access to the books and I’ve seen the sales projections for year-end are off the charts. He’s kicked me out of all other company comms which I understand makes rational sense if I no longer work there, but he’s behaving very erratically. Going off current ARR multiples, looks like the current valuation would be around $5m.

Given I never took out a salary, and BIL cannot be trusted (he owns other 50%, we are fully bootstrapped no outside capital raised), what do I do to liquidate my shares ? I want out even if it means taking a discount and covering closing costs. It’s an EU climate health company and I believe it would make most sense to offer my position to a PE firm with existing EU portfolio companies.

I’ve started to look into options for listing on online marketplaces to find a buyer to fully buy me out, but I have never done this part of the startup journey of selling under duress.

Currently looking for a job in an insane job market as an IC, got the young kids, my wife and I on Medicaid but still need to figure out income to survive while I resolve the startup exit.

Any insights from those who may have walked this path would be appreciated, I’m desperately all ears as the financial strain and family isolation dynamics are not long-term positions i can withstand.",11,18,"[""Your best bet is to give your BIL an offer based on his own numbers for the future of the company.

Suspicious TikTok Ad Conversions – Anyone Experienced This?,"I recently ran an experimental ad campaign on TikTok, using Branch io to track events like installations.

After running the campaign for a day, TikTok reported 110 conversions at $0.70 per conversion, which sounded too good to be true. I double-checked in Branch, and it was indeed showing 100+ INSTALL events.

However, I noticed **0 signups**.

I’m also running smaller ads on Instagram, which are converting well. This makes the 100+ installations with 0 signups from TikTok suspicious—there’s no bug or red flag in our sign-in flow, as we’ve already had 1,000+ signups through other channels.

As far as I know, the only way Branch can log these INSTALL events is through the SDK configured inside the app. This makes it seem like someone or something is genuinely installing the app in bulk and then discarding it.

Has anyone experienced something like this before?

(I’m waiting for my Google Play Console metrics to update so I can debug this further. For now, I’ve paused the campaign.)",21,6,"[""Are you paying for installs, or paying for signups?

How to raise seed funding ? I would really appreciate your advice !,"So basically i'm a co-founder of a startup and we actually finished our mvp and we have users that are eager to join , we are adding them little by little so we can manage the server loads, but the thing is that we don't have funding to support our startup for long and we have no idea how to raise, where should i start ?

Ugly co-founder breakup,"Hi everyone,

We are 3 founders with equal shares and equal legal rights in our startup (a Delaware C corp). Recently, we've had some issues with one of our co-founders who has stopped performing and we also discovered he lied about some agreements we made within the founding team at the time of incorporation.

Long story short, he wants to leave, and we also want him to leave. However, it's become contentious as the departing co-founder has threatened to screw us up. We incorporated just six months ago, so his shares are unvested (which he is unaware of, as he doesn't really pay attention to legal details). He has demanded half of the investment we've received so far to buy back his shares, even though he is not entitled to it.

We know we can call a board meeting to remove him, but we are almost certain he will not sign the share repurchase agreement, even though our company has the contractual right to repurchase all his unvested shares at nominal value. If he refuses to sign, what are our options other than litigation?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",99,51,"['Shares are unvested. If he didn’t purchase the shares up front There’s no repurchasing.  There’s no payment required.

It also would not look too good in front of investors. But, of course, you do not need to follow that if you have good reasons.

"Raising funds in the US backed by USD$165.000 contract, is it possible?","Hi,

I will try to make it short. I own a company in South America and I got $15.000 USD equity free to start my own company some months ago and being part of an Accelerator program.

Christmas cools down the blood and clears the brain,"First time in the year I took some time off after developing and launching my product and having extensive business travels for sales and opportunities the last two months. I need this recharge for the next push of my project.

Funny thing is, I identified the different types in my Family & Friends during the Christmas days:
- the Believeres: they know that you will succeed, doesnt matter how hard or slow it may seem
- the Criticizers: your idea sucks, you are wasting your time
- the Skepticizsers: your idea seems good, but you dont have the competence to realize it
- the Emotional Support Group: they might not be interested in your project specifically, but they have warm words for you

For myself I long ago realized that F&F is for sure not the source of truth as they might not now the sector and specific field, but it matters actually more on a emotional level, like giving motivation and also knowing that people have your back.

Startup Christmas - Pain Point Giveaway ,"To celebrate the holidays in a startup fashion, I thought it would be fun to giveaway the most coveted startup currency for aspiring founders: pain points. 

I will start it off, and feel free to DM me if you have ideas that can *directly* and *clearly* solve them.

Coding:
1. Code like me - The most frustrating part of a lot of AI tools I use, like Cursor, is that it’s good at generating code, but that code often doesn’t feel like, work like, or structure itself like my code. Something that would fix this would be great, but only if it really works and feels frictionless.
2. Create the tests for my code I didn’t know I needed - A lot of AI tools can spit out tests no problem. The problem is if I’m going to the work to think up these tests, that’s half the brainpower. Something that can not only generate tests for me but really think through the tests I need would be something I’d actually want.
 
Cold Outbound:
1. I’m personally a believer in personalization: I don’t want to sound like an AI just reading their job title or a basic LinkedIn scrape. Something that could make an online dossier of info about them I could use could be useful if it’s done right. Why? Doing this research wastes time

Assistant:
1. AI Web Automator Like Loom AI. I see so many tools that claim to automate web workflows with AI, and they all seem like a pain in the ass to use or don’t work. If I had something as simple as loom where I could be doing some repetitive task online, give it a show of my task, and let it rip through the rest, that would be great. How to make this work and feel nice? No idea, but I’d buy if you did. Why? These types of tasks are often one-off, annoy me, and waste time

Communication:
1. My team and I often communicate on Slack about random issues, updates, and info. Something that could organize this so I can easily look back on any topic like a timeline, that would be huge. The kicker? I don’t want to have to search by specific topic, because half the problem is I don’t remember them all. The other kicker? I don’t want a huge directory of topics, because I’ll never be able to find what I’m looking for. Maybe the solution is to have some sort of automatic organization, timeline organization, or automated categorization. To be honest, I don’t know, but if you could make it easy to look back on specific topics, know what’s talked about, and make it manageable to read, I’d be in. Why? It’s a mess to track topics, sort through what’s going on, and stuff gets lost.",2,3,"['Final pain point:\n1. Often times a lot of my coding time goes into debugging tricky problems, refactoring code to be performant, fixing issues like accessibility, and so on. General LLMs I’ve seen do not do a great job at fixing these problems, probably due to polluted data that they’ve trained on, and there isn’t a solid way to really scan for these issues that feels seamless. If there was something really good at one or more of these tasks, and it worked well without breaking my code, I’d definitely pay for this', 'My pain points are mainly distribution: smth that searches the internet, and social media(Linked, quora, Reddit, facebook, company pages, etc) and finds prospects or problems companies are facing that you are solving. For example, someone posted like you how painful it is to use Slack and I have a solution that exactly solves that instead of me looking through Reddit it finds this post and comments so I can contact you directly. If there is such a tool i think it is way better than cold outbounds.', ""Amazing thread! Thank you for starting this. \n\nOn coding:\n- lots of my time was spent on fixing framework specific hallucinations: e.g. supabase rpc function, firebase, etc. unfortunately it's something I have to course correct over and over again \n\nOn product/UX:\n- coming up with new and novel UX patterns but having a harder time on discoverability and usability because everyone expected a chat nowadays \n- generating nice and different UX remains a challenge, it's either looking too much like any other products out there or doesn't look as well.\n\nThe last one is pretty vague but: constant context switching btw distribution, coding and design, and I feel like a lot of context/knowledge are lost from the constant switch and the LLM token limits. Every new conversation sets you back by some amount of time.""]",2024-12-27 21:24:50,Bulky_Mall_2128,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hnpd8b/startup_christmas_pain_point_giveaway/

If you take a look at the YC Companies for example, there has been a shift into the direction of AI companies (which is continuing) with most of the solutions you can imagine.   \nAt first glance, this seems like a great opportunity to see the amount of possible customers rise, but at the same time the amount of open source tools is also rising significantly. Non-AI-Companies may not know this yet, but in my daily life as a vc it seems like all of the AI companies are aware of this and use those tools. For me it seems to be pretty unlikely, that you can build better tools (this is not meant to be offensive in any way) than those open source tools and sell them to those AI companies on a daily basis in 2025. I would focus on selling AI to non AI companies - they are less aware of the amount of free opps. :)', 'selling to startups is a pretty dicey proposition. they generally don’t have money, and to be honest, the startups doing really technical shit just don’t often need (paid) third party tools.\n\nso maybe rethink that part.', ""My 2c:\n- selling thin tools or infra to AI startups is gonna be tough because 1) most of the tools can be built fairly easily on top of the existing open-source tools, 2) the space and models are just moving too damn fast and I just can't afford the dependency right now. \n- I do think AI startup founders could make good seed users because they are pretty open to try new things, but you gotta expand beyond that pretty quickly.\n\nWhat kind of products are you thinking?

Our factory is rather small and we have several proprietary operations that would show how exactly we make our products.

 “What if meme tokens could get married? “ My story from dream to disappointment,"At first, I thought the idea was incredible. 

I imagined a token launch platform where people could follow the launched projects, tokens could become friends with each other, and even get married and have children. The idea captivated me so much that, despite my limited blockchain knowledge, I thought I could handle the entire project on my own. I even had a slogan ready: The social media platform for tokens.

I spent the first three months writing contracts, then the next three months learning frontend and backend development. By the end of six months, I had a working prototype. I was amazed—did I really pull this off?

I immediately uploaded it to a server, set up the necessary social media accounts, and after a few posts, I waited.

But no one came… not a single soul. A couple of social media influencers didn’t help either—turns out they were just manipulating their follower counts with fake accounts. Later, I found out that for $200 on Twitter, even Britney Spears will follow you…

That’s when I realized marketing is just as important as the project itself. But I had neither the network nor the funds to do proper marketing. I thought I could raise money by launching a token for the project, but messages to several token launch sites and dozens of VCs didn’t get me anywhere either.

Now, I’m working a full-time job and saving up money for my project. 

I wish all of you a happy new year ",0,5,"[""So you spent 6 months working on an idea that you didn't validate at any point?"", 'I genuinely can’t even begin to imagine why anyone would want to use that.', ""Build in public.

Red Flags When Choosing Business Cofounders - A Tech Founder's perspective ,"After 15 years building startups as a technical founder, here are the critical red flags I've encountered that every technical founder should watch for:

🚩 1. **Disconnected from Their Target Market**
- They're trying to solve problems for people they don't know or understand
- No existing network or connections in their target industry
- Can't demonstrate deep understanding of customer pain points

🚩 2. **Treating You as ""Just the Tech Guy""**
- Not valuing your strategic input beyond coding
- Dismissing your vision and ideas for the business
- Poor collaboration and one-sided decision making

🚩 3. **Equity Red Flags**
- Offering low equity while expecting you to build the core product
- Unwilling to discuss fair equity splits
- Only fair if they already have paying customers or significant traction

🚩 4. **Waiting for the Perfect Product**
- Not doing any marketing or sales until the product is ""ready""
- Using product development as an excuse to delay customer engagement
- Lack of parallel progress in business development

🚩 5. **Financial Behavior Issues**
- Unclear about sharing costs and revenues
- Delayed payments or reimbursements
- Lack of transparency around money matters

🚩 6. **Blaming Product for Lack of Growth**
- Always saying ""we can't grow because the product needs X feature""
- Not talking to customers or gathering feedback
- Refusing to iterate based on real market needs

🚩 7. **Self-Centered Leadership**
- Never asking about your perspective or wellbeing
- Only focused on their own vision and needs
- Poor team communication and collaboration

The Bottom Line: A strong founding team needs mutual respect, shared vision, and complementary actions. Your co-founders should be actively building the business while you're building the product.

Does finding a cofounder here actually work?,"I see regular posts here of founders looking for a cofounder. It’s a common request I get as an advisor and in our communities. So, I get it. 

I’m curious of any success stories? It seems like a long shot to me. But then again, there might be tons of networking that occurs with more than I’m acknowledging. 

If there was a success, what was the main factor?

I know many founders that have tried YC’s solution without success. But there must be a reason it still exists. 

Getting a right cofounder takes time. Treating it like a shotgun wedding is a recipe for disaster more often than not. I’ve seen many startups shut down or never get lift off so many times this way. There’s a reason many investors dig into the foundation of how cofounders met and how they’ve worked together through the rough times. 

But I could be wrong and there’s a way to meet cofounders here I’m not seeing. It would help a lot of founders I know.

We built a tool to help you find relevant grants. Would you pay for it? ,"Hi everyone,  
  
About a year ago, I asked you guys whether it would make sense to develop a tool to help entrepreneurs find relevant grants. Many of you provided incredibly valuable feedback, which we used to refine the concept. With this concept, we went through Techstars and finally launched a beta version of our grant scan tool last week!

Along the way, we realized something interesting: when you ask a grant advisor which grants might be a great fit for you, they almost always recommend the ones they know well. This makes sense since most work on a success fee basis, and referring you to lesser-known grants (which take more time to write and have lower success rates) isn’t worth it for them. Plus, memorizing the details of 20,000+ grants is, understandably, pretty tough. 

Our platform uses AI to scan and analyze thousands of grants. It identifies the best matches, estimates your chances of success, and calculates how much time you might need for the application and reporting phases. We can then match you with a grant advisor with relevant expertise—whether to write the application for you or provide feedback on your draft.

We’re considering launching both a free and a paid version. The free version would provide basic insights, while the paid version would include more comprehensive results, expert comments (such as explaining why certain grants are a good fit), and updates when new relevant grants become available. Both versions will allow you to connect with relevant experts.

Would you pay for the paid version? And if so, which features should it include?

Also, any general feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks!",13,33,"[""I might pay for it one time to compare results, or do a free trial to compare. If it didn't find something we found on our own, I'd just simply not renew.

Best of luck!"", ""No.  AI and Google can do the same, and they're free.  Finding things is free in the information age.\n\nNow instead, automatically apply to them all at the press of a button?

Should I Learn Frontend Dev or Hire Someone for My MVP?,"Hey everyone,

I’m in the process/thought of starting a SaaS company , and I’m stuck on a decision I could really use some perspective on.

Here’s the situation: I’ve got a solid background in backend development / Cloud and experience in leadership/sales, but when it comes to frontend dev, I’m at a beginner level. Now I’m debating what to do for my MVP:

1. **Learn Frontend Myself**
   * It feels like a good long-term skill to have, and it would give me full control over the MVP. But  it’ll probably take time. 
2. **Hire a Frontend Developer**
   * This seems faster and would likely result in something more polished. But it’s obviously going to cost more, and I’d need to find someone reliable to work with.

I’m also wondering if there’s a middle ground—like learning just enough frontend to get the basics done and hiring someone for the tricky stuff or the final touches. **I don't want to end up in a loop where I try to do/develop everything myself and end up spending too much time on development, where the product does not reach daylight in the end (been there before).**

So, I thought I’d ask:

* If you’ve been in a similar position, what did you do?
* Is it worth learning frontend as a solo founder, or should I just bring someone in and focus on what I’m good at?
* Any tips for a good incentive structure / keeping costs low if I decide to hire someone?

They seemed serious about developing it and we all had fatigue. Of course, they seemingly did nothing with it, there were no profits. If you sell to someone who is to move forward with your project, make sure they pay something up front to show they\'re serious about it.\n\nRidiculous in hindsight.', 'Business broker here. \n\nSaaS/AI/tech businesses tend to be next to worthless when small, and then a few explode in value. \n\nThe ones that blow up in value find a big enough problem to solve, create a great software product, and dial in a customer acquisition process.

SaaS from idea to reality for a non programmer.,"In need of real advice. 

I'm not a programmer  with some ideas and limited cash.
I work in finance in the fintech world, and i need to find out what does it takes to turn an idea into reality, into profits, and then into scale.
I worked in several fintech companies, and all of them are lacking structure and proper workflows, which creates inefficiencies and cost them a lot of money, but they don't seem to realize that. Most of them are relying on 3rd party providers that cost them even more money to do the job in parts and pieces, but they don't actually solve the cause of these inefficiencies.
This could be solved by having a proper POS system that also reconciles accounts.
This product would need to be a web based app with several user permission accesses, PCI compliant, the data preferably hosted by the client (cloud or in house),  be dynamic and designed to support seamless integration with external systems via API, SFTP,  ftp, MT940.
The pricing would be reasonable if it was between 30k-100k for license (yearly depending on the scale of operations of each business) 10-20k integration plus additional consultancy and maintenance fees for about 80 eur per hour.
As i mentioned in the beginning, cash and therefore human resources is unfortunately limited, but i want to know how to turn the idea into a functional business.",5,31,"['obligatory xkcd https://xkcd.com/927/', 'Yeah you are going to need a boatload of VC for this type of thing.

homecafé - Your New Way to Socialize Over Coffee,"Coffee lovers, I’ve got an idea brewing and I need your input!

Introducing Homecafé:
	•	Imagine this: You walk into someone’s home, greeted by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the warmth of a cozy, personal setting.
	•	The Concept: Homecafé pairs coffee enthusiasts—hosts and guests—to connect in intimate home settings, share coffee rituals, and spark genuine conversations.

Why Homecafé?
	•	Tired of the same old café vibes? Homecafé offers a personal touch, where every cup of coffee comes with a story.
	•	Looking to meet new people? Coffee becomes the perfect excuse to start meaningful conversations and build connections.

How It Works:
	•	For Hosts: Share your passion for coffee, welcome like-minded guests, and make your home a hub for great conversations.
	•	For Guests: Explore local coffee experiences, discover unique brewing methods, and connect with fellow coffee lovers in a relaxed setting.

I’d Love Your Thoughts!
	•	Does this concept excite you? Would you join as a guest or host?
	•	What features or functionalities would make this app stand out?
	•	Any concerns or ideas to improve the experience?

Your feedback could help shape this idea into something special! Let me know what you think—thanks for helping me brew this concept!

Thoughts on the next big thing?,"Hello everyone,

I’m a student founder, and I’ve met some successful venture capitalists/angel investors over the past year who come to my school to give advice about startups and what industries they invest in and why. 

Usually, the conversation leads to them saying some jargon along the lines of “solve big problems,” “take risk!” etc. But for most of these lectures, if not all, they talk about this wave analogy, where you have to look into the future about 7–10 years from now and build that startup if you want to be a “disruptor.”

I know, as of right now, a lot of startups are riding this wave of AI solutions, but what’s after that? What industries do you guys think will blow up after AI becomes the new normal? Some ideas I have are maybe security companies against deepfake tech, but that probably already exists.

I’d love to hear what everyone thinks!",0,20,"['Do something that someone will pay for.', 'Ignore what investors say.\n\nFind something you enjoy, find some users in that area, solve a problem those users are having. \n\nIf you want to raise VC money just try to make sure there are enough users to make it interesting.

They will probably be right eventually, but thus far they've been huge holes that investors and corporations have thrown money into without much if any return.\xa0\n\nWhich brings us to AI...it is still in its early phases but it is improving rapidly and since AI can be used to improve itself, it's going to mature from its current adolescent stage of walking to making the fastest humans look slow very quickly...within 5 years most likely and not longer than 10 years. It is probable that the\xa0current fragmented scene of AI for every industry niche will eventually implode and the remaining few AIs will end up dominating as they will do most everything users could want to do pretty well.\xa0\n\nSo what follows AI?

Need an advice on my early startup's next steps,"Hey everyone, 1 month ago I released my B2B app and acquired my first users. (2 free, 2 paying customers). My user base is not technical people so having face-to-face meetings helps convince them which is what I did and I turned them into customers in 1 or 2 meetings.

I am a solo developer for this app and now I am in a place where I need to choose between a couple of options.

First I build the app with Firebase & React Native. I also built a Node.js backend just in case but it has not been deployed since iterating with Firebase is fast and I don't want to deal with a migration now.  
I also have a full-time job, so I am using my spare time to develop the app, have meetings, etc.

I am concerned regarding the technical scale of this thing. So having my backend is always can increase the capabilities and reduce my cost. (Don't expect any huge costs until 10000 customers since it's firebase)

Option 1 (Introduce backend heavy co-founder):  
I have some friends who want to help the app, with decent backend knowledge. I can let them join, migrate the app, reduce the client-side login, own the FE & Sales, and Let him handle the backend and own the FE in time.

Option 2 (Introduce frontend heavy co-founder):  
I don't have FE-heavy friends who are interested in the app currently, I can try to find someone with FE or Full Stack knowledge of my tech and offboard the technical stuff. Focus heavily on sales. Try to scale

Option 3 (Continue Solo)  
I can be more disciplined and scale this to, I guess 50 paying customers, and doing this may reduce the equity I give to other people or the investors. But, it will consume a lot of my energy.

Option 4 (Accelerators)  
Or I can try to create a deck and start looking for accelerators & incubators, but being a solo founder is a negative point mostly, so this option can go hand in hand with op1 or op2

Additional information, I can sell the app, but I am really technical, and customer maintenance is manageable for at least 50 small businesses. Never tried marketing for an app, don't really know how to as well. Rather continue having face-to-face sales for the first 100 customers.

We are two individuals currently building a product. While we consider ourselves co-founders, we don’t officially have a founders’ agreement in place yet. Additionally, we haven’t registered the business yet.

New as a co-founder - any advice?,"Hello everyone  
  
I was offered a partnership with a new startup still working on its MVP. My participation will be my time and experience in my field. I will not invest any money from my side. I love the idea and the founder seems to be a smart guy.

We agreed that I would work a few days a week with no salary until we get an investment or the company becomes self-sustained and that my equity share will be vested over the course of 18 months.

I've started a business before, but this is my first time partnering with someone.   
  
Based on your experience, what are the things I should thoroughly discuss and pay great attention to entering this partnership, and make sure it is included in the shareholders' agreement?",6,16,"[""Former lawyer who went to work in VC here. Here's my 2 cents:\n\n1. Equity ownership and vesting- like everyone else here is saying, make sure you're getting proportionate share of value from this venture. You mentioned that your equity is vesting in 18 months, but is this in clear writing? Everything in black and white; you can't imagine how many co-founders I've seen screw each other over this when the startup really takes off.\n2. Exit Plan- buyout options, valuation methods, and how shares will be distributed if you or the other co-founder wants out. You can't take for granted that how things are now will continue long-term into the future. Also consider the terms of what happens if you quit before or after the vesting cliff. \n3. Intellectual Property- Define who owns the intellectual property created during your partnership. This should be the startup as a business entity, not any individual founder. Huge red flag to VCs is when the IP is held by one of the co-founders rather than the startup itself.\n4. Non-Compete and Confidentiality- let's say your co-founder decides to leave and you take over things. You need to make sure the party leaving doesn't compete with the startup by simply redoing what you've worked on but for another venture.\n5. Dispute Resolution clauses- save yourself a lot of time and money in the long run by having this outlined at the very start. This helps especially if your co-founder has significantly more capital to screw you over in court. Arbitration and mediation are much cheaper alternatives that you can enforce with the right clause beforehand.\n\nTL;DR protect yourself as early as you can. This may seem like a small project now but huge problems can arise if it really takes off and disagreements occur. My advice would be to get a startup/VC specialist lawyer to look through your agreement right now and help you draft terms for your benefit while doing a contractual review of the terms proposed by the co-founder. Lawyers are expensive, but the expense now will save you a lot of trouble in future."", ""Establish a clearly defined value for your work, how that value translates to percentage ownership, and how you can cash out when its time.  If that function isn't in your agreement, you might never be able to cash out. Include takeover clauses, so that if the business goes inert you could opt to carry the torch."", '18 months is a short vest.

Competitive differentiator question,"Hi, How do you answer the competitive differentiator question super early in a startup's life? 

I am not in a crowded space but it is unlikely that someone else in history has already tried the idea.

Lessons after launching for the first time.,"Hey guys, I just wanted to have a quick discussion and share our learnings after launching our recent product Potarix.



1. Just get it working - We initially battled with serverless platforms like Google Cloud Run and Vercel for days to deploy because we needed a very specific environment to run a scraper. Just spin up an EC2 instance if you find yourself battling with any type of serverless infrastructure. It’ll take like an hour to deploy any application you want. You can always fix it later.
2. If you’re launching a time-consuming service, you need a way to save the work. - Our platform can take 5-10 minutes to complete a task. If the user clicked off the page in any way, it would throw off the app, and the task would fail. To remedy this, we quickly launched a concept of “jobs.” Now, every job you create is saved alongside its results as well, so you never lose information when you click off the page.
3. Launch with analytics - It's difficult to figure out what your users are doing with your product. Make sure you launch with analytics. We didn’t do that on our first launch and have no idea what users were using our platform for. We quickly integrated Mixpanel right after our first launch, and it's fun seeing what our users are doing!



What do you guys think? Anything I’m missing that you guys have learned?",6,7,"['Lean into your differentiators hard and prioritize them over boring/standard features you can do manually (eg setting up user roles via UI).\n\nDifferentiators can be non-tangible like obsessive customer support, but you need to lean into it.

Growing a Product locally that has been imported from foreign country.,"Hello folks,

I have an agricultural product that recently became quite popular in my country and we have been importing from our neighboring country. I would like to plant the crop on my own by renting the agricultural land. I have a list of importers and their contact info. I am pretty sure it will be easier for them to buy locally than importing with all import tax and all. What are the possible challenges I as a farmer could face? At first, I thought of selling the product on my own with my brand on different e-commerce websites. Since many vendors are selling the same product, I am afraid I will not be able to generate a profit and would rather sell the product at wholesale price. what are the pros and cons of selling as a retailer vs wholesale?

The Art of Finding a Co-Founder ,"I just came across some posts & articles recently, mostly from self-proclaimed business influencers & former founders (wna be influencers), sharing their's take on **finding a co-founder**. The underlying theme seemed to revolve around finding a partner itself & when you look at history, the concept of having a female co-founder often comes with the notion that there should already be mutual commitment or at least some level of mutual attraction

The takeaway? It's like a herculean journey itself: spending significant time finding a girl ( single & critical thinker), building trust & making them comfortable, possibly turning the dynamic into a relationship & then convincing them to step into the role of a **co-founder** ( there separately you gotta deal with her time, circumstances & family)

So basically the efforts required undoubtedly comparable to excelling in a national level competitive race & the success rate is probably just equivalent to launching a startup in an oversaturated market.

"Trying to build a new marketplace for India, struggling with GTM.","Hello!

So we've started a livestreaming marketplace in India after looking at the success of livestream commerce in China and the recent success in the US.

We're fairly early on in our careers and are people who are willing to experiment and wok hard, but its getting increasingly difficult to figure out how to take our product to market given we don't have a lot of runway left and we need to show some solid numbers to pick up venture funding.

There were companies who tried this model in India before during Covid when Tiktok got banned here, we've spoken to a bunch of them and figured out the core problems they faced.

\- They acted mostly as a replacement app to fill the tiktok void and commerce was added as a means to raise investor funding. Commerce was never the core focus.

\- They went after very indistinguishable products where the repeats were low (think cheap electronics, homeware)

\-They paid big influencers a bunch of money to come and do lives and burnt through cash.

\- Their primary audience was from semi urban, rural areas and hence the content on the app quickly moved to being super low quality.  
What we are doing differently :

\- Taking a commerce first approach and going after niche categories where users are super engaged and make purchases very often ( We are trying to pick and choose categories very carefully, have definitely made mistakes (we though thrifted apparel and handmade jewellery would do very well, but it came with a huge share of supply related ops issues), we accidentally stumbled on vinyl records as a category and it gave us really good results in the first few trial livestreams and hence we niched down to just focus on this category for a while. Even though the category is really small in India, users are super engaged (we had slightly more control over the supply as well).

\- We have completely stayed away from involving influencers / content creators for lives and even for our own social media content.

\- Similar to the Vinyl category, we plan to pick categories where the audience is super engaged, we can drive higher AOVs and create good content for the lives to be engaging. (The next few we are thinking of are sneakers, vintage collectibles, high value women's ethnic clothing and so on.)

We launched our app alpha in September this year, got a bunch of real user feedback, fixed bugs, figured we cant do without a web version, so launched the web version as well. We realised the app's UI and design wasn't that great, so we are revamping it too.

What we are doing on the marketing bit right now - Focusing on making really good quality social media content, making DIY content by ourselves, making content about the products on the platform and our sellers.

We have recently started to do offline popups to build more awareness. We also realised our branding was very off so we are getting that in line. Overall it feels very disorganised and unfocused, we have gotten the feedback that even though people think what we're doing is cool they don't always get what we're trying to do.

Help me pivot,"Dear fellow entrepreneurs,

I'm in need of some advice on how to pivot my product.

I'm working on an expenses tracker and the core tech & UX design is solid. The web-app is centered around processing uploads of bank transactions and categorizing them.

Unfortunately I've just discovered that the core demographic of my MVP now has access to many of the features of my app through their banks native interface, which essentially undermines my value proposition for that user group.

That's a real shame of course because I was very close to launching the service which was scheduled for start for somewhere in Q2. The only steps that were left was hooking up a payment provider and making a landing page with a sales funnel plus some QA and pen-testing. 

So I'd say that was about 70\~75% of my MVP done and I now need a new plan. Honestly, although I'm bummed out, I rather find out now than getting feedback on launch that my app is a dud, so I also see this as an opportunity to take my code and see how I can move forward with it.

Here are a few opportunities that I've identified off the top of my head:

1. I could extend my app and move past the original scope of on-boarding user from a single bank and open it up to include multiple banks, which greatly increases my range, but also means much more work before I can go live at the risk of other banks beating me to the punch again...not likely, but there's always a risk.

2. Move away from mobile and web-apps and explore target the ""sit down to do your finances"" demographic aka boomers with a desktop view and the MVP accessible through the browsers, but later on building a desktop app. However this is a market that I'm totally unfamiliar with and also technically I'd be somewhat out of my depth...

I'd love to hear your thoughts on possible ways to position myself moving forward. All ideas and feedback are welcome :)",1,6,"['Aim for third world countries and specifically their state recognised banks.

Integrate a GenAI that reads receipts and populates plus captures all relevant tax data and separates it from cost of goods/services. Not all expenses are weighted the same when writing off expenses. \n\nIf you are stuck on the single user model then you simply need to look at what’s out there (and there are many) find the gaps and fill them with yours. Spend a small fortune on marketing and put in the work to sign up as many users as possible.']",2024-12-23 08:18:53,SoftSkillSmith,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hkjca0/help_me_pivot/

"How my open source repository exploded into a movement, and where to go from here.","I've launched like 10 projects in the last 3 years that have all fizzled out. Solving problems nobody had, or couldn't market effectively. Whatever the reason, it was always months of building and then shutting it down 2 weeks after shipping.

This summer I started building tools for NSFW content, in fact one of those failed products was an adult content search engine. Yesterday I chose to make the tools open source, and when I shared them in the relevant communities they got immediate traction. The GitHub started getting stars, people began asking for a community around it. So I built a discord and a subreddit which each added 250+ users within 24 hours, and quickly growing.

It seems that I've hit on a nerve, a lot of developers are building products in this space and are frustrated with the lack of support. So I've started with open sourcing some utilities, but may end up taking it to a hosted SaaS depending on how demand looks.

People are talking about us being the first ones to ship NSFW videos models, and it's actually not too far out there and has like stupid market potential. The costs would be crazy high though to get going, at least for a few individuals. One of the reasons I made my tools open source was because I ran out of funds to keep exploring training models on my own.

Need Advice on Launching a Remote Tech Outsourcing Company,"Hi everyone,

I'm a software engineer, and I, along with a team of experienced colleagues, am planning to launch a remote tech outsourcing company. We’re confident in our skills and teamwork, but my concern is whether we can consistently find enough projects to sustain ourselves in the long term.

Here’s our plan:

* **Offer Reasonable Pricing**: Leveraging our geographical advantage, we aim to provide competitive rates without compromising on quality.
* **Trial Period**: We plan to start small and register as an LLC only after some trial and validation.

To reach more clients, particularly from the US and Europe, I’m considering:

1. Hiring a US-based representative on a commission basis (5–10%) to generate leads and supply projects.
2. Exploring cold outreach strategies and targeted online marketing campaigns.

I’d appreciate your advice on the following:

**Lead Generation**: Are there other effective ways to attract and secure potential clients in Western markets?

**Commission-based Hiring**: Is hiring a US-based individual on commission a viable approach, or are there better alternatives?



Our website is almost ready, and we aim to launch at the beginning of 2025. Based on your experience, what might I be overlooking in this plan? I’d love to hear from anyone who’s walked a similar path or has insights on building and scaling a remote outsourcing business.

Thanks in advance for your help!",1,13,"[""Outsourcing isn't promising right now, and here's why:\n\n1. AI solutions are reducing traditional outsourcing leads\n2.

But if the representative is actively participating in working with the client, as well as solving those communication problems, then they would be someone expecting to get well paid.

Re: US rep - tried this exact approach. 5-10% commission wasn\'t enough to motivate quality sales people.

How to Persistently follow up on Sales and Discovery conversations,"Hi I am a startup founder and have a dozen ""Discovery"" meetings a day. Since I am fairly small, I am first of all fairly lucky to even get the meeting. 

But very often, after those meetings, it is annoying to have to follow up for all the introductions or resources they typically point me towards. Most people are nice but getting that follow up is really hard. 

My questions are:

\* How persistently or long do you keep following up?

\* Do you try capture other information like Email, LinkedIn, phone etc so you can ping them even more?

",6,7,"['\nVP of GTM here: \n\nSo much to unpack here. The best thing you can’t do is set solid next steps while you are meeting them. If other people need to be there get their info  and set the call with your current contact and them. Always try to book your next meeting while on the current meeting. \n\nIf they are unwilling to commit to another meeting there is a bigger issue that no amount of follow up with help with. You are about to get ghosted. Try to make that next meeting as soon as possible.\n\nThat is a good amount of discovery meetings. I would kill for that many in a week.', 'A few tips, based on my own experiences with sales and marketing:\n\n- Always have an action item decided on at the end of the call. Typically, this means scheduling the next meeting while still on the initial call. You might get some push back, but being a little pushy (without being too annoying) does work. For example, when people say ""I\'ll need to check with \'Person X\' before moving forward"", I\'ve said something like ""Ok great, I can send you both an invite right now, and give you edit permissions in case you need to move it to a time that works for you. Also, feel free to invite anybody else on your end that would be excited about our platform. Does that sound good to you?""\n- Drive the conversation. For example, it sounds like you\'re still in the very early stages. This is typically a good time to get people to sign LOIs that basically say they\'d pay for your product if you built it with features X,Y,Z. So, instead of saying something like ""Would you be willing to sign an LOI?"", say something like ""Glad to hear you\'re excited about what we\'re building! For next steps, I can send you an LOI that lists out your requirements, and once you sign that, we\'ll get to work to <solve X problem> for you."". Changing my language like this made my discovery calls go SO much better, it was wild.\n- In terms of following up, I typically do ~5 follow-up before I give up. Though I\'ve heard people have success even up to 10 follow-ups lol. The trick is, don\'t just follow-up saying ""Hey just following-up here"". Always have some new and exciting information to share. For example - ""Hey ___, we just added <feature X> and helped <customer Y> solve <problem Z>. I remember you mentioned in our last call you had the same problem, are you up for a quick call so I can tell you more about our new offering?""\n- I wouldn\'t try to capture other information so you can ping them on other channels. They\'ll just get annoyed with you.\n- Try more organic channels. For example, post about your product in subreddits that are relevant to your industry. You might get some inbound requests, which typically convert at a much higher rate than outbound.\n\nMy DMs are always open, feel free to ping me if you have any follow-up questions! I love early-stage sales and marketing, and I currently help lots of founders find customers on social media.', ""Been in this exact spot. The follow-up game was killing me until I figured out a system that worked.\n\nWhat made the biggest difference: Having my VA handle our entire follow-up process. Initially thought it'd be impossible to delegate but it transformed our pipeline.\n\nOur current process:\n\n* VA takes detailed notes during calls\n* Sends personalized follow-up same day\n* Tracks every promised intro and resource\n* Follows up 3x max over 2 weeks\n* Moves to monthly updates after that\n\nOne thing that worked well: Recording calls (with permission) so nothing gets missed. Makes follow-ups much more specific and meaningful.\n\nFor contact gathering - we just do basic research before calls. LinkedIn + company website usually has everything needed.\n\nOn persistence: If no response after 2 weeks, we add them to our monthly updates. No point burning bridges with aggressive follow-up.\n\nHappy to share our follow-up templates if helpful."", 'So the reality here is you need to have your own defined sales process and probably need some upskilling. The concept of discovery and follow ups is different for everyone and I think that maybe you haven’t quite dug deep enough into the what, when and why of sales along with the how. \n\nStrongly suggest you set up a standardized process that includes proper information gathering as well as progression so that you aren’t wasting your time in a bunch of meetings that go nowhere.']",2024-12-21 21:23:47,Fine4FenderFriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hjjj85/how_to_persistently_follow_up_on_sales_and/

"I'm working to build a project management business, am I on the right track?","# Intro/Who I am

I'm currently working towards launching a project management business that specializes in helping organizations with limited in-house project management resources or expertise. I have been a professional project manager for 11 years in the oil/gas, and chemical industries and have personally led projects (OPEX, CAPEX, and EPC) in over 10 different countries across 4 continents (14 or 15 countries if you count the ones I've led remotely).

# My plan so far

I first outlined the services I would like my business to offer:

**1. Project management as a service:** Which is basically end-to-end support, from planning and risk management to execution of projects and handover.

**2. Organizational support:** Helping companies build in-house project management capabilities through training, development of standards, procedures, and my own personal best practices that I apply, but tailored to each organization and their needs, capabilities, and backgrounds. This arm of the business is actually something I do very well in all the jobs I've ever had, and it is something I enjoy quite a lot.

The types of projects I will focus on:

1. Depending on project goals: OPEX or CAPEX projects
2. Depending on project phases:

* Early phase (Like feasibility studies), where we will deliver risk assessments and mitigation plans, SWOT, cost estimation, project execution plans, etc.
* Execution phase projects, where we deliver construction management, commissioning executions, etc.

# Why I think I have something here (value proposition)

I know the pain-points when it comes to projects. I also know that not all organizations are set-up to manage projects. They don't have access to the resources needed to successfully run a project (positions like project coordinators, planners, buyers, document managers, let alone PMs are not always available unless it's a huge corporation). I happen to have access to a not-bad network of these folks who I can contract on a per-project basis. By doing so, I can help organizations manage and execute high-value projects without the extra overhead, headcount, or costs associated with retaining the level of experience needed.

I've done some math, focusing on the UAE market (more on that later) but it can be extrapolated to other regions, and hiring a team of project personnel (the positions above) with 5 year experience will cost between $20,000 and $25,000 a month in salaries alone.

My firm aims to supply these project teams on a per-project basis for a fraction of that (for a 6-month project it may be equivalent to the cost of 1.5 or 2 months overhead).

# What next

I want to validate my idea, which is why I need your help. As much as I know the business area I just don't know *business.* Am I thinking on the right track here? I want to end up in the UAE in the next 2-3 years due to personal connections and history. Currently I am a full time senior PM in Western Europe.

My thinking is that I look for a few pilot projects in the meantime to learn the pitfalls, blind spots, and challenges I haven't thought of yet. For this I'm really open to any location, I can travel wherever if needed.",2,2,"['Sounds like you want to become a freelancer?\n\nIt should be possible, other people also do that. \n\nOne of the biggest challenges could be finding customers.\n\nBig companies likely have a frame agreement already with the big 4 or other consultancy agencies.\n\nSo why should a company hire you instead of going to an agency? Likely because you were recommended by someone in their network.

Moving my whole Family to New York to chase my dream. ,"I'm 32 (m) and live in Melbourne Australia with my wife and 4 month old son. 

Started my career in SaaS Sales, started, ran and sold a few businesses on the side (some more serious than others). My real passion, however has always been in Capital Markets. As an 11 year old I watched the movie Wall Street about 50 times and just knew 'that' is what I wanted to do and I became obsessed with that whole world and have been ever since, I love all the famous activist investors like Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn. However, when I first left school I didn't follow my passion, life sort of got in the way. 

In early 2023 I left my comfortable well paying SaaS job to be a full time entrepreneur/investor. Not to sound arrogant but so far, I've been pretty successful. I've turned $300k (my life savings) into just over $2m all while having a pretty good standard of living (our life style costs around $10-20k a month). 

This year I made my first activist investment, and found my onto the board on a publicly listed company here is Australia and have played a role in turning that company around. Last financial year the company made a $4m loss. I bought about 10% of the company while the stock was at an all time low and the company should break even this year (but we are still not out of the woods yet). 

Trouble is I'm not moving quickly enough, I need to raise some capital in order grow and scale and make more activist investments.

Australia however is a very conservative market. We just don't have the same access to capital as people in the US have. 

So our plan is to move to New York for 3 months for me to pound the pavement to try and raise money for a fund that will specialise in undervalued small-mid cap companies on the ASX (Australian Stock Exchange).

My wife is super supportive and I love her more than anything for encouraging me to do this. The worse case scenario is we spend about $100k to live in the US for 3 months and we come back home and just keep doing what we are doing. 

Am I fucking nuts for doing this? Does this have any chance in hell of working? Is it irresponsible to take a young child to New York for that long?

Or is this cool? And I'm actually going to take the plunge and chase my lifelong dream?

Looking for someone who have tried several low-code solutions, and can though a bit of advice!

I'm about to start low-coding some MVP ideas, but I cant decide on the which low-code tool.

Startup structuring advice,"I recently joined a startup as a cofounder. We're looking to setup the business after the new years to make filing easier and are planning to use clerky. I don't have any startup experience he does.

It's me and the other founder, who is the one who had the idea and has been working at least the last two years to building the product (SaaS). I do very little of the development, i'm mainly just there to take as much off his plate as possible and he was looking for someone he could be good friends with to build a company together.   
He has pretty much all the dev and domain experience. I am putting in all of my time into the business now and working hard to get up to speed so I can take things off his plate on the business/marketing side.

The structure that is set up, which I want to ask advice on is as follows:

He wants to keep ownership over the software he has build and wants to own IP, in order to protect me in case someone wants to buy the IP. He mentioned putting the IP in a holding company of which he owns 90 percent and I own 10 percent. The holding company would license the software, with clauses such as non competes and free licensing to the 'main' company we are setting up.

The main company is pretty much split equally (34/33.5 percent with him having voting control, and some equity left aside for friends/family to have the opportunity to invest in, and some left for other investors,employees etc.)

  
He has seemed very forthcoming and fair in all his dealings. I'm just mainly worried about the implications I dont know with him having almost full ownership that he retains under the holding company. And that if we are looking to be bought out I would get a much smaller payout if they'd mostly be interested in the software.

He is developing a system that can be applied to different areas of business, of which we focus specifically on the one area of business right now. So i'm thinking of adding a clause that further software being developed specifically for the business domain we are setting up the main company will be IP under our company which we have split up equally and that to sell the company we'd both have to be in agreement.

  
Any insightful thoughts are highly appreciated.",1,0,[],2024-12-21 05:47:03,Yung-Snipes,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hj3fkp/startup_structuring_advice/

Now we are going into another call to share more stuffs about the project, long term vision etc.

What are questions or things I need to do to find out if this is really the guy I want working with for the next years? Know that we are compatible.

I’m in Miami and he’s in Denver. It’s not like we are gonna be working in an office for the time being until we really get there, raise fund and need to be together.

What’s the process? I know it’s like dating again but I don’t know how to date a technical person or what to look for in that regard. 

He worked in the same domain I’m in (which never happened on the many other calls), he uses the same coding language, have the same vision and goal, understood and knows the problem, knows the market.

I’m thinking on the following “filters”:

1.Have a call with a technical friend who offer to interview him.
2.Have a call with one of the angels investors
3.My wife says that I should give him a small project to do and see what he comes up with (see how he thinks, create, deliver etc) I was thinking on re design the page.

Help me choose a platform ,"Hey all, so if you’ve were building a marketplace where sellers of a niche product, let’s say handmade audio speakers, could sell directly to the community (audiophiles) who buys that niche product, which platform would you use? 

It needs to: 

- Allow sellers to create ‘stores’ where they list their products. 

- Allows buyers to purchase said products, and the seller to ship directly to them (we won’t be holding inventory), 

- Allows us to post content like videos and interviews etc, 

And, 

- Allows us to integrate stripe connect for the platform fee (a % of each sale) we charge. 

Our target audience are pretty young and design conscious, so design is kinda important. I.e we need a fair bit of control over the aesthetic. 

Should we look at building a custom site and integrating some kind of ecommerce platform? Build directly on an ecommerce platform? 

Thanks in advance for any tips! ",5,2,"['Depends on your budget. If you want cheap and fast, founders use Shopify to validate and start making money.\n\nIf you want low barrier with ability to customize more, Wordpress has a ton of plugins.

Loads of out of the box templates and starting code packages are out there as a starting point. Every dev has their preference. \n\nBut my advice is to always start cheap and validate first.

My initial thought (but became clearer just now) is to build an mvp for 2 purposes: to get users to get feedback and to find and attract potential tech cofounders whom I can select from.",3,29,"['Ugh.', ""Cursor/Claude/AI can help you get things out the door, and this may be fine for an MVP, but it's going to cause problems for you down the road. The overall data model and technical architecture are critical to scalability, and the AI solutions aren't (in my experience) good at this. This is where a technical person is critical. It seems you get this from your post, but I wanted to state it for others reading this thread. \n\nAlso, I'm not a developer - I'm a product person who has been around the block and has seen spaghetti code impair product growth. \n\nAs for co-founder vs CTO - at your stage (pre-product), I think the difference is largely academic. Either will (rightfully) expect significant equity. Either way, you need to find someone who aligns with your working style and vision. Changing the title won't matter much."", ""C titles doesn't mean anything as long as you are a three person startup. Maybe it starts being meaningful above 25 or 50 employees. \n\nAI is great, but when you need to fix production issues ASAP when customers are trying to use your paid product is a fast way to hell.\n\nI would ask myself how do you think you can build a product and talk to customers if you are scared to talk to an entrepreneur spirited engineer? \n\nYou might not need a tech co-founder. Build an MVP, secure some funding and hire a programmer.\n\nDon't be scared of anything, life is too short for that."", ""Post MVP you'll need a tech person either a co-founder or employee to scale it and remove any tech debt generated by the AI"", ""Im high experienced developer, who had beed worked as CTO in startup yet wasn't co-founder.  \nMy thoughts about it is: co-founder is a person, who care about your product because owning a port of it. CTO - employee, who wants to earn or learn.\n\nThat is only about you, do you need to someone else who cares about your product except you or you are good. \n\nYet, you need CTO in any case, since it is a person, who not just the most experienced, but someone, who manage all tech processes from selecting tech stack, choosing dev strategy, resolving tech conflicts to solving challenges. \n\nAs no-tech guy, you even can't imagine you have problems in your tech until it will be too late and easier to sell company than fix it.\n\nUnfortunately, I saw it many times, when startups started to seek for CTO in moment it is too late.\n\n  \nAs a summary, I think, any startup must have a CTO, but not everyone founder must have co-founder.  \nIf your startup is a tech startup, you must be a tech guy or have a tech co-founder.\n\nOnly one exception when you do not need CTO - if your company is too small (less than 10 tech employees) and you are going to sell it in near future."", 'If you can generate enough revenue yourself to hire and pay someone, more power to you', 'TLDR - AI is good for basic MVP. After that, you will have to build the project from the beginning.\n\nAI at this stage is good for simple proof-of-concept projects. You can use it to build some of the MVP functionality, etc. But as soon as you get into enterprise solutions, get ready to scrape the majority of the code and, in practice, build the entire project from scratch. \n\nThe main issue is related to database architecture and technical debt. If you think your startup can survive that type of hiccup, then go for it. If not, then find a proper CTO/founding engineer. \n\nKeep in mind that the majority of companies that charge $2k a month for a team of 5 are the same. Think about it this way: If the developer can’t find a job at Upwork for more, then he is not worth your time.', 'You seem like you need a technical cofounder other than Claude.

Has anyone else noticed that inexperienced founders are poor at documentation?,"My experience is from meeting a couple people on YC cofounder matching/online, who are looking for a dev (me) to join their b2b idea. We talk, they have an idea, and talked to a few or couple potential customers, but can't produce any recordings or transcripts of their conversations. Or a document summarizing their findings and the market research. I'm immediately disinterested at how little information they can produce.

They just tell me the idea over a call as if I'm going to remember everything, and as if they remember every insight from those conversations.

I'm in a b2b startup rn, and I record every customer call, and note down interesting snippets/emails in a doc. When I look back at recordings, I realize that there are many nuggets that I didn't remember. And that's even with a good memory.

GCP or other AI Startup Cloud Credits,"Wanted to see if anyone has any tips.

We have an actual AI-based solution (not just wrappers) and can fund our work with our own investments, cashflow, 100k-300k, but it would also be great to get cloud credits from GCP, AWS, etc.

Startups expecting free work?,"I don’t understand where people get the audacity to expect free work on their terms. A friend of a friend asked me to meet about “hiring” me part-time on their startup. I figured I could probably work on it a few hours a week, so I messaged them back and had a meeting. They said they expected me to volunteer and I wouldn’t get any money or stock. I laughed. Then they said that I’d need to put in 10-20 hours a week on a schedule doing software development work and I’d *possibly* get a chance to get paid in the future. They told me that they know I do great work and I would be a valuable addition. Apparently not valuable enough to pay haha. Obviously, I’m not doing that. I just don’t understand where people get the expectation of free work from. It’s crazy to me! If I started my own startup, I wouldn’t expect to hire anyone on unless I was able to pay them to give them a part of my company. Is this a normal thing in the startup world? 

Edit to add: They also went back to my friend and said that I was “unhelpful” and “not dedicated to my work as a SWE” because I wouldn’t volunteer my time. It’s laughable haha.

What's the sweet spot for traction for a pre-seed company?,"Ideally you'd would walk into a VC firm with amazing traction numbers and they'd be so excited, you'd only have to pitch 1-2 VCs before closing your round.

I mean , I want to spend time building my product not pitching to VCs.

The question I have is what's the sweet spot? 

If I don't have decent traction and try to raise I'll spend all my time in meetings.

If I want too long then I'm hindering my growth as I don't have enough money to grow my company.

I'm not an Internet celebrity, didn't graduate from Stanford or anything so I don't have any 'suspend belief' magic behind me.

I also want to only raise based on *ME* and without a co-founder.

I did a co-founder last time and didn't enjoy it.  I want to be a solo co-founder and instead bring in an amazing team later.

I'm not ruling out a co-founder it's just so difficult to find one.

So basically, how much revenue, customers, etc do I need as proof of traction to VCs?",10,43,"['Only pitching 1-2 VCs is a joke. Even if you could you should still pitch several. Couple of reasons:\n\n- You’ll refine your pitch every time you do it\n- Most will say no, often without any good reason\n- Many are momentum driven so once you have a lead it’s way easier to get followers, but finding the lead is hard\n- If the first convo ends in a yes, you should still pitch more to make it competitive and “hot”\n- If anybody does even hint at a yes, ask them to lead.

While not yet validating a willingness to pay, this pilot establishes engagement metrics and validation of product success across a real customer. \n\nPaid pilots are the first in a sliding scale of traction points that increase the probability of a startup’s success and also the ability to raise VC $s.

Looking for introverts 👀,"

Hi there, as the title says, I’m looking for an introvert with great ideas but maybe not the confidence or social skills to pitch them. I want to challenge myself, create opportunities, and step into the authority I was born with.

I didn’t get to go to college, but I’ve learned that it’s not always necessary. Many people with degrees have even told me not to waste my time on it and to keep doing what I’m doing. I’ve been fortunate to have mentors across different fields who’ve guided me, but my mentor in tech has inspired me the most. He was building a startup before transitioning into politics, and watching him work behind the scenes fascinated me. I got to sit in on investor meetings and pitches, and even though I wasn’t in the spotlight, I loved the energy in the room. That experience lit a fire in me, and now I want to take things a step further.

A Little About Me:
I’m an ambivert with introverted tendencies, but my social skills are strong enough that people often mistake me for an extrovert. Growing up, I took care of my grandfather, who only spoke Spanish and was illiterate, which forced me to interact with the world at an early age. That experience shaped me in ways I didn’t even realize until later.

In school, I was one of the smartest in my class, and teachers would often use me to help tutor kids who were falling behind. Most schools I went to hardly had honors classes and my high school had 1 AP class! (Wish I was joking about that). I was considered for skipping a grade, but my parents didn’t want me to miss out on being with kids my age. Those early experiences gave me confidence in how I communicate and connect with others. It’s a skill that has opened countless doors for me—both personally and professionally.

What I’m Looking For:
I’m looking to partner with someone who has a great idea an app, startup, side hustle, whatever, but struggles with pitching it, sourcing funding, or just putting it out into the world. I believe people buy the story before they buy the product, and storytelling happens to be one of my strengths.

If you’re someone with vision but not the confidence to step into the room, I can do that for you. I’ve been exposed to the tech startup world, and while I’m no stranger to the challenges of pitching, I thrive in environments where stories are told, connections are made, and ideas come to life. Whether it’s working on pitches, meeting with investors, or brainstorming ways to move forward, I’m here for it.

Someone who wants to build a healthy working relationship and believes in healthy communication and boundaries. I understand how valuable others ideas are and want to also create healthy professional boundaries. 

Why Me:
I’m a hard worker (it’s the Latin gene), quick learner, and able to adapt to just about any situation. I’m not afraid of confrontation or having hard conversations, and I thrive on being direct and getting things done. Bilingual and am comfortable in both English and Spanish. Open to be pushed 

I’m the person who grabs life by the horns, and I want to use that energy to help someone else’s idea grow while gaining experience myself. I understand what it’s like to be underfunded and bootstrapping, so we can figure out an arrangement that works for both of us. I don’t do this kind of work for free, but I also know how to be flexible when we’re both starting out.


Let’s Connect:
If you’re someone with a great idea but need a partner who can tell your story, connect with the right people, or just take some of the load off your shoulders, let’s talk. I’m excited to collaborate and make something impactful together. Don’t hesitate to reach out I’m ready to get to work.

I definitely have weaknesses that are not listed here because that’s not the topic here and can let you know what they are. But my weaknesses have gotten me far and fuel me daily.

"10 Years Later: Struggling between startup dreams and stability
","**TL;DR:** I’m a technical founder who, after a decade of side projects and pivots, now runs a small digital platform making about $200/month. It barely covers costs and requires freelancers. I’m torn between quitting my job to go all-in or keeping my safety net. Any advice?

Hi everyone,

I’ve been at this for about ten years, starting out with a WordPress plugin that made around $60k over two years. After moving from the Middle East to Europe, adjusting to a new job and culture slowed my side-project momentum. Several attempts followed—some profitable, some dropped due to logistics, and one failed startup accelerator partnership.

My current venture is a platform tailored to the MENA region. Initially it was a Calendly-like product, but after 18 months, I pivoted to a Shopify-style marketplace for digital goods. I’ve got about 50 active monthly users, each making around $100/month, and I take a 5% commission. That’s roughly $200 MMR—enough to cover $200 in infrastructure costs, but not the additional $600 I pay freelancers monthly.

I’ve often tackled problems I couldn’t personally relate to. Now I’m solving one I’ve experienced myself, which is more fulfilling, but still tough.

I’m 37, have a girlfriend, and feel torn. Should I quit my full-time job and commit fully, or maintain this juggling act to stay financially safe, especially given the uncertain economy? I’d really appreciate any thoughts, lessons learned, or advice on how to move forward.

"Two notifications this morning: one bad, one good.","Hi startup folks, this morning started with two news, bad and the good one (of course I would like to switch them)  
  
A bad one: another rejection email from Y Combinator. It’s very disappointing, but of course it’s not the end of the road. We had two interviews with YC during these 2 years (applied 6-7 times). Rejections are just part of the process, and every “no” gets us closer to the next “yes.”

Where to find a marketing cofounder ,"I've built two Shopify apps this year - an analytics tool and an order editing app. Recently bought out my partner, and now I'm stuck in the classic developer's trap: The products need constant work, leaving zero time for marketing.

The few customers I have absolutely love the products and stick around, but growth is non-existent. I've got two years of runway saved up, but I spend every day buried in code - I’ve recently a had more time to try get more users but it’s really not my thing. 

Should I keep going solo and somehow force myself away from development to learn marketing? Or bring on a marketing co-founder and give up equity? After just buying out one partner (he lost interest right after we launched), I'm hesitant to give it up again.

Startup Struggles and Career Paths,"Hey Fellow Startuppers,

I’m feeling somewhat disoriented at the moment because I have several possibilities for my future career. However, some of them don’t seem entirely satisfactory, and I’m not sure I have a full picture of all the available options. I’d like to reach out to you for advice and insights based on your experiences. Perhaps some of you can relate and share interesting perspectives.

I’m in my mid-30s and plan to defend my PhD next year. Currently, I’m finalizing my dissertation on cryptologic topics, including Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), encryption security definitions, and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

Two years ago, I began exploring the idea of a startup focused on PQC migration services, such as an automated CBOM discovery toolset. I even managed to motivate some of my colleagues to join as co-founders. Unfortunately, the team dissolved because my colleagues opted to work for large companies with stable, well-paying jobs—which I completely understand! However, the downside was that building such a tool required a deep understanding of different programming languages at a functional level. My skill set, as a cryptology specialist with expertise in cryptographic implementation and theoretical security, didn’t equip me to develop such a tool independently. I also found that other colleagues (from both industry and academia) weren’t interested in joining a venture, preferring to focus on completing their PhDs and pursuing other career aspirations.

As a result, about a year ago, I shifted my focus to something I could manage on my own at a technological level. I started developing an encryption and processing service based on homomorphic encryption, which I have employed in several ongoing publicly funded research projects. I’m currently preparing a scientific publication on this work.

I also partnered with someone knowledgeable in GDPR and legal matters—a complementary skill set for this venture. However, after six months of collaboration, I realized this person was unreliable and unpredictable. Following multiple red flags, I decided to part ways and proceed independently.

Despite these challenges, the project shows promise. I am actively building the engine, and the business model is clear. However, I’ve encountered a significant hurdle: selling PETs to companies is exceedingly difficult. Only a small portion of companies prioritize privacy, largely because their customers don’t demand it. Many companies collect vast amounts of user data (e.g., geo-coordinates) without any plans to utilize it—practices that are not only legally dubious but also insecure. Data leaks could cost these companies heavily, yet they often remain indifferent.

When I approach companies (e.g., CISOs) to discuss privacy and security, I feel like I’m hitting a wall. I currently have some leads for next year that might convert into paying customers, but I suspect my sales pitch is falling short. Earlier this year, I had two very promising leads, but when I proposed pilot collaborations, both stated they had more pressing issues and couldn’t commit—at least for the time being.

This makes me wonder if I’m failing to convey the value of my proposition effectively. I’m convinced my solution offers a high ROI, but I’m unsure how to better articulate its merits.

Overall, I’d describe my current state as “not good, not terrible.” The upcoming year might bring better outcomes. Encouragingly, some VCs have expressed interest in my idea. However, without any initial revenue—even modest—I worry that my valuation will be significantly lower.

You might ask why I’m so concerned after just a few setbacks. The answer is that I’m juggling this venture alongside a full-time managerial role, which is becoming increasingly tedious. I feel like my technical expertise is slipping away the longer I continue in this role, which gives me an unsettling gut feeling. At this moment, I would be happy just to quit my job and work somewhere else. However, I’m sure that if it’s not a startup with some cryptographic aspects, I’ll end up facing the same gut feeling again.

My plan for the next year is as follows:

\- Continue pursuing the remaining leads and secure at least one paying customer by the end of May.

\- Pitch my idea to startups with similar concepts and explore the possibility of joining them.

\- Look for startups in need of a CTO with my skill set, even if it’s unrelated to my current idea. I would especially appreciate any advice on where to find such startups.

  
If you have additional suggestions i would be very grateful to hear them. Thank you for reading :)

When To Move On From A Project?,"What metrics or factors are most important when deciding if a project is worth continuing or not?

I am 24 and have been working on a project for about two years now after work and on weekends. Although two years is a long time to work on a project, I found it justified. On first launch, we organically obtained 300 users in two weeks, 40-50% of users were consistently active and paying customers, doing well on socials etc. Customers were giving voluntary, overall very positive feedback about the platform. Nothing crazy but enough to validate the idea. We ended up having to bring down v1 and pivot semi drastically and have been working on v2 ever since.

At the time, I was working on the platform with a lifelong friend. He did the frontend/design while I did the backend framework, database, cloud services, servers, data visualization, etc. I also do all the social media, content creation, promotion, legal, administration, etc. However, he has now decided not to work on the project anymore, leaving all the remaining frontend work to me. I know nothing about frontend, so I am at a crossroad.

On one hand, I could find a frontend cofounder. As I'm sure some of you know, easier said than done. I see this process taking at least a couple months, most likely more. On the other hand, I can just take 6 months and learn frontend technologies so I can finish the project myself.

I don't see anything from a ""startup metrics"" standpoint that makes me think I need to move on to something new from that perspective, but I am starting to wonder if it would be more worthwhile to build  something I am more capable of finishing front to back myself, and in less time than it would take to learn frontend and continue the project. How do you decide when it is time to move on from a project? Where is the balance between learning what you need to get it done and wasting time learning something you should bring in help for? Any advice is much appreciated.

2. Help users do backtesting of the portfolio along with 100s of key financisl ratios and metrics
3. Along with that I have a plan to implement ml in it across 100s of metrics where the system would keep on testing portfolios to find which key ratios actually are most associated with high growth portfolios.
4. An ai base sentiment analyser which would suggest better decisions on investment prior to events so before us election it should analyse and tell that tesla will grow if trum wins (would require human inverntion)
5. A retirement planning based on goals of individual and suggesting different plans
6. Roboadvisory sevice for time crunch investors

This is what I have thought in broad terms.

While I am unable to share the details of the startup, the startup is a tech-enabled business in the B2C space. Currently, the business is such that we have assisted onboarding of each customer and the team is heavily involved in converting the customer to a paid customer with a decently high ticket size. There is a simple tech product that just works.

I will handle technology and marketing, while the founder will take care of direct sales, relationship management, business operations and business financials.

"Building what’s missing, even when the world doesn’t see it yet","I recently asked someone if they’d be interested in beta testing my app. It’s free, I told them—just download it, click around, and give me honest feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and what could be better. Their response hit me harder than I expected: “There are already so many social media apps. I’m tired of them. I don’t think it’s going to be successful.”

For a moment, they planted doubt in my mind. Social media is oversaturated, and people are burnt out. But here’s the difference—this app isn’t like the others. I’m not building something to trap people into endless doom scrolling. I’m not trying to keep people glued to their phones for hours.

This app is about real connection. It’s about finding ways to be social again, to discover things to do, to get out of the house and engage with the world. It’s social media, but with a purpose: to make people more social in real life, not less.

I know it’s a risk. I know I’m jumping into a crowded space. But I didn’t secure an LLC, patent the intellectual property, or pour my savings into this just to quit before it’s had a chance to thrive. I believe in this project. I believe it’s what’s missing.

Will it be the next Instagram or TikTok? Probably not. But that’s not the point. If even a small community uses it, sees its value, and thinks, “This is what I’ve been waiting for—I didn’t even realize I needed it,” then it’s worth it.

Sometimes, you have to build what’s missing in the world, even if others don’t see the gap yet. I’m building it because I want to use it, and I haven’t seen anything like it on the market. I’m okay starting small, growing steadily, and keeping the integrity of what this app is supposed to be.

How much opportunity is left in the AI Video Generator market?,"I was browsing Product Hunt and stumbled upon Hedra, an AI-powered video creation platform.

After doing some research using a few tools, I discovered that Hedra has just hit over 1 million monthly visits!

What’s even crazier is that the search volume for “Hedra” surged by 3500%+, from 6,600 to 246,000 monthly searches between Nov 2023 and Apr 2024.

Hedra has secured funding, so part of its growth could be attributed to a solid marketing budget. However, the product itself is top-notch, with incredibly high-quality video output. Companies like Synthesia, Pictory, Runway, and Lumen5 are also making waves in this space. It seems getting more and more competitive recently.

I’m curious If there is anyone else building AI-powered video creation tools right now?

What are the current breakthrough points in this space?

Specifically, are there any niche areas that have real demand for AI-generated video content? I think there might be a few niche areas:

\- e-commerce

\- ​sales personalization videos ( I've seen a few on Product Hunt)

\- tools that slice long videos into multiple viral short videos

Is This the Right Time to Start Hiring for My Startup?,"Several months ago, I launched my startup, an innovative platform designed to streamline e-commerce transactions for small businesses. The initial response has been promising—we've gained traction in our target market, received positive user feedback, and are steadily increasing our customer base.

However, as we scale and introduce new features to enhance user experience, the workload is becoming overwhelming. I find myself stretched thin, juggling development, customer support, and marketing efforts almost single-handedly. While I'm passionate about wearing multiple hats, I recognize that expanding our team could accelerate growth and ensure we meet customer expectations effectively.

Yet, I'm apprehensive about taking this step prematurely. How did you decide when it was time to hire for your startup? What signs or milestones indicated readiness for expanding your team?

",4,16,"[""Tricky.  Focus.  \nWithout knowing your product or market, I'd say this:\n\n\\- Stop developing features to enhance user experience for now. You don't seem to really need them as you're already growing and receiving positive feedback. More features means more maintenance, more questions and more support. \n\n\\- Only develop to reduce support questions. This will also be important later when you've grown 10X.\n\n\\- Focus on sales and marketing. Learn what channels/segments/strategies/funnels etc work best. Build the machine that sells and delivers the product. Delivery of your platform is every bit as important as its functionality when you sell to many small businesses.\n\n\\- I guess first hire should be in sales/marketing but i cannot be sure. Anyway do this: Create a job description, create a training&handover plan for your new teammember. this will tell you if you're ready to effectively employ new hires. Prepare resources and tools and test them by doing it yourself for a while.  (but not too long, build the machine and don't become it)\n\n good luck, and enjoy!"", 'There are a number of different issues that could be the deciding factor.\xa0\n\nFirst of all there’s a question of your energy and mental health. If you keep pushing yourself at your limits there is a very real risk of burnout.\xa0\n\nRelated to that is the question of what happens if there’s a dip in productivity. Will the business survive if there’s a disruption to its operations?! If equipment break, or a person or two must prioritize something in their personal life, can the business stumble and catch up without long-term damage?!\n\nAnd then there’s the question of expansion and growth.\n\nLook at what your vision is for your business a year from now, three years, five years, and compare the required past for that vision with where your business is heading right now. Are you doing the work today required to achieve your own vision?', 'For me, the decision to hire came when I noticed two key things: first, essential tasks were slipping through the cracks or taking too long to complete, and second, the opportunity cost of not delegating was holding back growth.

If you're spending most of your time on support/maintenance rather than building new features or addressing customer needs, it's time.\n\n\n\nI'd suggest starting with a technical hire who can take over development, freeing you to focus on product vision and growth. For customer support, consider AI tools first (what we did at jenova ai) - they can handle a surprising amount of basic inquiries before you need dedicated support staff.\n\n\n\nRemember: each hire should unlock significantly more value than their cost.

Would Corporate Professionals find this useful?,"Hi everyone, 

I’ve been working on an idea to make fitness more accessible for busy professionals, and I’d love some feedback from this community.

The concept is a marketplace that connects personal trainers and clients. Here’s the twist: you don’t need a gym membership to train with a PT. Instead, you can book a session through the platform, and the gym allows you access for that session. The gym gets a cut of the trainer’s fee, so everyone benefits.

This also solves a major issue for personal trainers. Many are restricted by contracts that only let them work at one gym location. This limits their ability to grow their client base. By connecting trainers to clients across multiple gyms, they can expand their reach and income while maintaining flexibility.

I’ve noticed that many corporate professionals struggle to find time to work out, and gym memberships often go unused. This model aims to give people more flexibility and remove barriers like memberships while helping trainers overcome location restrictions and grow their client base.

My questions are:

1. Do you think corporate professionals would find this valuable?
2. What’s the best way to validate if this solves these pain points?
3. Could features or elements make this more appealing to companies, employees, or trainers?

I’m open to any thoughts or suggestions, so feel free to critique or share your perspective.

Cheers,",1,2,"['Some realities to consider:\n\n1. Gym business model relies on unused memberships - your idea fights this core dynamic\n2.

In real deep,"I really went all in on my SaaS start up. Mid-30s, married with kids. Left a $350k a year job. Dumped $300k+ into it. Ended up taking a lot longer than I thought and it cost me so much to maintain the biz and pay for my cost of living from savings for 3 years without an income. Ended up raising a pre-seed, but it wasn’t enough to pay myself anything. Ended up selling my second home to use the equity for living expenses. I’m now $150k in debt (0% interest), and down to my primary residence and a modest retirement account. We’ve rented out the house and moved to a cheaper place, but it’s not enough. 

We are about to sign our 5th B2B client (~$40k/yr each) and I’m feeling the momentum. Probably not PMF, but it feels like it’s around the corner. We’re not quite at the revenue for a seed, and I worry that it can be another 6-9 months to get to a closed seed. The fundraising environment has sucked and it cost me too much precious time away from sales. 

Anyway, I’m burning through my last little bit of savings and it’s incredibly painful. Each month I’m wasting time juggling bills and moving money frantically to make ends meet. I really need to make ~$100k to live modestly and pay for this mountain of debt. No options seem good…

1. Get a job - Don’t even know how I could manage this without quitting my startup. 

2. Consulting / Gigs - I’ve done a small amount of this, but it’s distracting unless I spend a considerable amount of time on it. 

3. Sell dream home / go bankrupt - My 5 year old LOVES our house and it would be heartbreaking for all of us. I would subsequently go bankrupt, but I don’t know if that would just mess things up for my business anyway. 

4. Raise - I don’t think we’re at seed-level ARR yet, so I could do an extension so it doesn’t take so long to raise. But I can’t see myself taking $100k from investor money yet. 

I’m sure some of you have had some personal finance pressures, so I’m hoping for some wisdom. 


Edit: These options were not in my preferred order. I don’t want to do anything that distracts me from the business. I would suggest looking at this business as if it’s not a lost cause or we somehow are chasing a fantasy. Imagine the exit potential is $30MM in 2 years, or $100MM in 5 years. 

Edit #2: For those of you thinking the business is in shambles or we’re not close to PMF: Notion, Linear, Loom, Airtable, Slack, and Figma didn’t even have their FIRST CUSTOMER until after their 3rd year. Sometimes up to 5th year. We have a few 5-figure ARR customers that love our product, and we’re fully aware of the market potential. Chill, Karen.
